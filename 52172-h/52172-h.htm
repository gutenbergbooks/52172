<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>That the thorough study of concrete animal types is a
necessary preliminary to good work in Zoology or Comparative
Anatomy will now be granted by all competent judges. At a
time when these subjects, though much lectured upon, were
rarely taught, Döllinger, of Würzburg, found out the right
way. He took young students, often singly, and made them
master such animal types as came to hand, thereby teaching
them how to work for themselves, and fixing in their minds a
nucleus of real knowledge, around which more might crystallise.
“What do you want lectures for? Bring any animal and
dissect it here,” said he to Baer, then a young doctor longing
to work at Comparative Anatomy<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> It was Döllinger who
trained Purkinje, Pander, Baer, and Agassiz, and such fame
cannot be heightened by words of praise. In our own time and
country Döllinger’s methods have been practised by Professor
Huxley, whose descriptive guides, such as the Elementary
Biology and the delightful little book on the Crayfish, now
make it easy for every teacher to work on the same lines.
From the description of the Cockroach in Huxley’s Anatomy
of Invertebrated Animals came the impulse which has
encouraged us to treat that type at length. It may easily
turn out that in adding some facts and a great many words to
his account, we have diluted what was valuable for its
concentration. But there are students&mdash;those, namely, who
intend to give serious attention to Entomology&mdash;who will find
our explanations deficient rather than excessive in detail. It
is our belief and hope that naturalists will some day recoil from
their extravagant love of words and names, and turn to
structure, development, life-history, and other aspects of the
animal world which have points of contact with the life of
man. We have written for such as desire to study Insects on
this side.</p>

<p>Whoever attempts to tell all that is important about a very
common animal will feel his dependence upon other workers.
Much of what is here printed has been told before. The large
number of new figures is, however, some proof that we have
worked for ourselves.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant duty to offer our thanks for friendly help
received. Professor Félix Plateau, of Ghent; Mr. Joseph
Nusbaum, of Warsaw; and Mr. S.&nbsp;H. Scudder, of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, have very kindly consented to treat here of
those parts of the subject which they have specially illustrated
by their own labours<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> Mr. E.&nbsp;T. Newton, of the Jermyn
Street Museum, has lent us the wood blocks used to illustrate
one of his papers on the Brain of the Cockroach. A number
of the figures have been very carefully and faithfully drawn
for us by Miss Beatrice Boyle, a student in the Yorkshire
College. We are much indebted to Dr. Murie, the Librarian
of the Linnean Society, for procuring us access to the
extensive literature of Insect Anatomy, and for answering
not a few troublesome questions.</p>

<p>Five articles on the Cockroach were contributed by us
to Science Gossip in 1884, and some of the figures were then
engraved and published.</p>

<p>In issuing a book which has been long in hand, but which
can never hope to be complete, we venture to adopt the
words already used by Leydig concerning his Lehrbuch der
Histologie:&mdash;“Die eigentlich nie fertig wird, die man aber
für fertig erklären muss, wenn man nach Zeit und Umständen
das Möglichste gethan hat.”</p>

<p>The lovers of minute anatomy have always been specially
attracted to Insects; and it is not hard to tell why. No other
animals, perhaps, exhibit so complex an organisation condensed
into so small a body. We possess, accordingly, a remarkable
succession of memoirs on the structure of single Insects, beginning
with the revival of Anatomy in the 17th century and
extending to our own times. The most memorable of these
Insect-monographs bear the names of Malpighi, Swammerdam,
Lyonnet, and Straus-Dürckheim.</p>


<h3><i>Malpighi on the Silkworm.</i></h3>

<p>Malpighi’s treatise on the Silkworm (1669) is an almost
faultless essay in a new field. No Insect&mdash;hardly, indeed, any
animal&mdash;had then been carefully described, and all the methods
of work had to be discovered. “This research,” says Malpighi,
“was extremely laborious and tedious” (it occupied about a
year) “on account of its novelty, as well as the minuteness,
fragility, and intricacy of the parts, which required a special
manipulation; so that when I had toiled for many months at
this incessant and fatiguing task, I was plagued next autumn
with fevers and inflammation of the eyes. Nevertheless, such<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
was my delight in the work, so many unsuspected wonders of
nature revealing themselves to me, that I cannot tell it in
words.” We must recall the complete ignorance of Insect-anatomy
which then prevailed, and remember that now for the
first time the dorsal vessel, the tracheal system, the tubular
appendages of the stomach, the reproductive organs, and the
structural changes which accompany transformation were
observed, to give any adequate credit to the writer of this
masterly study. Treading a new path, he walks steadily forward,
trusting to his own sure eyes and cautious judgment. The
descriptions are brief and simple, the figures clear, but not rich
in detail. There would now be much to add to Malpighi’s
account, but hardly anything to correct. The only positive
mistakes which meet the eye relate to the number of spiracles
and nervous ganglia&mdash;mistakes promptly corrected by Swammerdam.
Had the tract De Bombycibus been the one work of its
author, this would have kept his memory bright, but it hardly
adds to the fame of the anatomist who discovered the cellular
structure of the lung, the glandular structure of the liver and
kidney, and the sensory papillæ of the skin, who first saw the
blood-corpuscles stream along a vessel, who studied very early
and very completely the minute structure of plants and the
development of the chick, and whose name is rightfully
associated with the mucous layer of the epidermis, the vascular
tufts of the kidney, and the follicles of the spleen, as well as
with the urinary tubules of Insects.</p>

<p>All that we know of Malpighi commands our respect. Precise
and rapid in his work, keen to discover points of real
interest, never losing himself in details, but knowing when he
had done enough, he stands pre-eminent in the crowd of minute
anatomists, who are generally faithful in a few things, but very
unfit to be made rulers over many things. The last distinct
glimpse which we get of him is interesting. Dr. Tancred
Robinson, writing to John Ray, from Geneva, April 18th, 1684,
tells how he met Malpighi at Bologna. They talked of the
origin of fossils, and Malpighi could not contain himself about
Martin Lister’s foolish hypothesis that fossils were sports of
nature. “Just as I left Bononia,” he continues, “I had a
lamentable spectacle of Malpighi’s house all in flames, occa<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>sioned
by the negligence of his old wife. All his pictures,
furniture, books, and manuscripts were burnt. I saw him in
the very heat of the calamity, and methought I never beheld so
much Christian patience and philosophy in any man before; for
he comforted his wife, and condoled nothing but the loss of his
papers, which are more lamented than the Alexandrian Library,
or Bartholine’s Bibliothece, at Copenhagen.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Swammerdam on the Honey Bee.</i></h3>

<p>Swammerdam’s great posthumous work, the Biblia Naturæ,
contains about a dozen life-histories of Insects worked out in
more or less detail. Of these the May-fly (published during
the author’s life-time, in 1675) is the most famous; that on the
Honey Bee the most elaborate. Swammerdam was ten years
younger than Malpighi, and knew Malpighi’s treatise on the
Silkworm&mdash;a not inconsiderable advantage. His working-life
as a naturalist comes within the ten years between 1663 and
1673; and this short space of time was darkened by anxiety
about money, as well as by the religious fanaticism, which in
the end completely extinguished his activity. The vast amount
of highly-finished work which he accomplished in these ten
years justifies Boerhaave’s rather rhetorical account of his
industry. Unfortunately, Boerhaave, whom we have to thank
not only for a useful sketch of Swammerdam’s life, but also for
the preservation of most of his writings, was only twelve years
old when the great naturalist died, and his account cannot be
taken as personal testimony. Swammerdam, he tells us, worked
with a simple microscope and several powers. His great skill
lay in his dexterous use of scissors. Sometimes he employed
tools so fine as to require whetting under the microscope. He
was famous for inflated and injected preparations. As to his
patience, it is enough to say that he would spend whole days in
clearing a single caterpillar. Boerhaave gives us a picture of
Swammerdam at work which the reader does not soon forget.
“His labours were superhuman. Through the day he observed
incessantly, and at night he described and drew what he had
seen. By six o’clock in the morning in summer he began to<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
find enough light to enable him to trace the minutiæ of natural
objects. He was hard at work till noon, in full sunlight, and
bareheaded, so as not to obstruct the light; and his head
streamed with profuse sweat. His eyes, by reason of the blaze
of light and microscopic toil, became so weakened that he could
not observe minute objects in the afternoon, though the light
was not less bright than in the morning, for his eyes were
weary, and could no longer perceive readily.”</p>

<p>Comparing Swammerdam’s account of the Bee with the useful
and amply illustrated memoir of Girdwoyn (Paris, 1876), it
is plain that two centuries have added little to our knowledge
of the structure of this type. Much has been made out
since 1675 concerning the life-history of Bees, but of what was
to be discovered by lens and scalpel, Swammerdam left little
indeed to others. It is needless to dwell upon the omissions of
so early an explorer. Swammerdam proved by dissection that
the queen is the mother of the colony, that the drones are
males, and the working-bees neuters; but he did not find out
that the neuters are only imperfect females. In this instance,
as in some others, Swammerdam’s authority served, long after
his death, to delay acceptance of the truth. It is far from a
reproach to him that in the Honey Bee he lit upon an almost
inexhaustible subject. In the 17th century no one suspected
that the sexual economy of any animal could be so complicated
as that which has been demonstrated, step by step, in the
Honey Bee.</p>


<h3><i>Lyonnet on the Goat Moth.</i></h3>

<p>In Lyonnet’s memoir on the larva of the Goat Moth (Traité
Anatomique de la Chenille qui ronge le bois de Saule, <span class="nowrap">1760<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>) we
must not look for the originality of Malpighi, nor for the wide
range of Swammerdam. One small thing is attempted, and
this is accomplished with unerring fidelity and skill. There is
something of display in the delineation of the four thousand and
forty-one muscles of the Caterpillar, and the author’s skill as a
dissector is far beyond his knowledge of animals, whether live
or dead. The dissections of the head are perhaps the most<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
extraordinary feat, and will never be surpassed. Modern treatises
on Comparative Anatomy continue to reproduce some of these
figures, such as the general view of the viscera, the structure of
the leg, and the digestive tract. Nearly the whole interest of
the volume lies in the plates, for the text is little more than a
voluminous explanation of the figures.</p>

<p>It is not without surprise that we find that Lyonnet was an
amateur, who had received no regular training either in anatomy
or engraving, and that he had many pursuits besides the
delineation of natural objects. He was brought up for the
Protestant ministry, turned to the bar, and finally became
cipher-secretary and confidential translator to the United Provinces
of Holland. He is said to have been skilled in eight
languages. His first published work in Natural History consisted
of remarks and drawings contributed to Lesser’s Insect
Theology (1742). About the same time, Trembley was prosecuting
at the Hague his studies on the freshwater Polyp, and Lyonnet
gave him some friendly help in the work. Those who care to
turn to the preface of Trembley’s famous treatise (Mémoires pour
servir à l’histoire des Polypes d’eau douce, 1744) will see how
warmly Lyonnet’s services are acknowledged. He made all
the drawings, and engraved eight of them himself, while
Trembley is careful to note that he was not only a skilful
draughtsman, but an acute and experienced observer. When
the work was begun, Lyonnet had never even seen the operation
of engraving a plate. Wandelaar, struck by the beauty of his
drawings, persuaded him to try what he could do with a burin.
His first essay was made upon the figure of a Dragon-fly, next
he engraved three Butterflies, and then, without longer apprenticeship,
he proceeded to engrave the plates still required to
complete the memoir on Hydra.</p>

<p>Lyonnet tells us that the larva of the Goat Moth was not
quite his earliest attempt in Insect Anatomy. He began with
the Sheep Tick, but suspecting that the subject would not be
popular, he made a fresh choice for his first memoir. Enough
interest was excited by the Traité Anatomique to call for the
fulfilment of a promise made in the preface that the description
of the pupa and imago should follow. But though Lyonnet
continued for some time to fill his portfolio with drawings and<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
notes, he never published again. Failing eyesight was one
ground of his retirement from work. What he had been able
to finish, together with a considerable mass of miscellaneous
notes, illustrated by fifty-four plates from his own hand, was
published, long after his death, in the Mémoires du Muséum
(XVIII.–XX.).</p>


<h3><i>Straus-Dürckheim on the Cockchafer.</i></h3>

<p>In beauty and exact fidelity Straus-Dürckheim’s memoir on the
Cockchafer (Considérations Générales sur l’Anatomie Comparée
des Animaux Articulés, auxquelles on a joint l’Anatomie Descriptive
du Melolontha vulgaris, 1828) rivals the work of Lyonnet.
Insect Anatomy was no longer a novel subject in 1828, but
Straus-Dürckheim was able to treat it in a new way. Writing
under the immediate influence of Cuvier, he sought to apply
that comparative method, which had proved so fertile in the
hands of the master, to the Articulate sub-kingdom. This
conception was realised as fully as the state of zoology at that
time allowed, and the Considérations Générales count as an
important step towards a complete comparative anatomy of
Arthropoda. Straus-Dürckheim had at command a great mass
of anatomical facts, much of which had been accumulated by his
own observations. He systematically compares Insects with
other Articulata, Coleoptera with other Insects, and the Cockchafer
with other Coleoptera. Perhaps no one before him had
been perfectly clear as to the morphological equivalence of the
appendages in all parts of the body of Arthropods, and here he
was able to extend the teaching of Savigny. His limitations are
those of his time. If in certain sections we find his collection
of facts to be meagre, and his generalisations nugatory, we
must allow for the progress of the last sixty years&mdash;a progress
in which Straus-Dürckheim has his share. It is the work of
science continually to remake its syntheses, and no work
becomes antiquated sooner than morphological generalisation.</p>

<p>It is therefore no reproach to Straus-Dürckheim that his
treatise should now be chiefly valuable, not as “Considérations
Générales,” but as the anatomy of the Cockchafer. Long after
his theories and explanations have ceased to be instructive, when<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
the morphology and physiology of 1828 have become as obsolete
as the Ptolemaic astronomy, the naturalist will study these
exquisite delineations of Insect-structure with something of the
pleasure to be found in examining for the hundredth time a
delicate organism familiar to many generations of microscopic
observers.</p>

<p>The fidelity and love of anatomical detail which characterise
the description of the Cockchafer are not less conspicuous in
Straus-Dürckheim’s Anatomie Descriptive du Chat (1846). Both
treatises have become classical.</p>

<p>We have seen how, in Straus-Dürckheim’s hands, Insect
anatomy became comparative. New studies&mdash;histology, embryonic
development, and palæontology&mdash;have since arisen to complicate
the task of the descriptive anatomist, and it appears to
be no longer possible for one man to complete the history
of any animal of elaborate structure and ancient pedigree.
As a method of research the monograph has had its day. The
path of biological discovery now follows an organ or a function
across all zoological boundaries, and it is in the humbler
office of biological teaching that the monograph finds its proper
use.</p>


<h3><i>Later Insect Anatomists.</i></h3>

<p>It is impossible even to glance at the many anatomists who
have illustrated the structure of Insects by studies, less simple
in plan, but not less profitable to science, than those of the
monographers. If we attempt to select two or three names for
express mention, it is with a conviction that others are left
whom the student is bound to hold in equal honour.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Dufour<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> laboured, not unsuccessfully, to construct a General
Anatomy of Insects, which should combine into one view a
crowd of particular facts. The modern reader will gratefully
acknowledge his industry and the beauty of his drawings, but
will now and then complain that his sagacity does not do
justice to his diligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span></p>

<p>Newport<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> a naturalist of greater weight and interest, is
memorable for his skill in minute dissection, for his many
curious observations upon the life-history of Insects (see, for
example, his memoir on the Oil-beetle), and especially for his
early appreciation of the value of embryological study.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Leydig<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> was the first to occupy fully the new field of Insect
histology, and point out its resources to the physiologist. In
all his works the student finds beauty and exactness of delineation,
suggestiveness in explanation. Leydig’s contributions to
Insect anatomy and physiology, valuable as they are to the
specialist, are not isolated researches, but form part of a new
comparative anatomy, based upon histology. Incomplete so
vast a work must necessarily remain, but it already extends
over considerable sections of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>The place of the Cockroach in the Animal Kingdom is illustrated
by the above table. It belongs to the sub-kingdom
Arthropoda, to the class Insecta, and to the order Orthoptera.</p>


<h3><i>Characters of Arthropoda.</i></h3>

<p>Arthropoda are in general readily distinguished from other
animals by their jointed body and limbs. In many Annelids
the body is ringed, and each segment bears a pair of appendages,
but these appendages are soft, and never articulated. The
integument of an Arthropod is stiffened by a deposit of the
tough, elastic substance known as Chitin, which resembles horn
in appearance, though very different in its chemical composition.
In marine Arthropoda, as well as in many Myriopoda and
Insects, additional firmness may be gained by the incorporation
of carbonate and phosphate of lime with the chitin. However
rigid the integument may be, it is rendered compatible with
energetic movements by its unequal thickening. Along defined,<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
usually transverse lines it remains thin, the chitinous layer,
though perfectly continuous, becoming extremely flexible, and
allowing a certain amount of deflection or retraction (fig.&nbsp;1).
The joints of the trunk and limbs may thus resemble stiff tubes.
Muscles are attached to their inner surface, and are therefore
enclosed by the system of levers upon which they act (fig.&nbsp;2<span class="smcap">B</span>).
In Vertebrate animals, on the contrary, which possess a true
internal skeleton, the muscles clothe the levers (bones) to which
they are attached (fig.&nbsp;2<span class="smcap">A</span>). The whole outer surface of an
Arthropod, including the eyes, auditory membrane (if there is
one), and surface-hairs, is chitinised. Chitin may also stiffen<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
the larger tendons, internal ridges and partitions, and the lining
membrane of extensive internal cavities, such as the alimentary
canal, and the air-tubes of Insects.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In most Arthropoda the body is provided with many appendages.
In Crustacea there are often twenty pairs, but some
Myriopoda have not far from two hundred pairs. Some of
these may be converted to very peculiar functions; in particular,
several pairs adjacent to the mouth are usually appropriated to
mastication. One or more pairs of appendages are often transformed
into antennæ.</p>

<p>The relative position of the chief organs of the body, viz.:&mdash;heart,
nerve-cord, and alimentary canal, is constant in Arthropoda.
The heart is dorsal, the nerve-cord ventral, the
alimentary canal intermediate. (See fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_3">3</a>.) The œsophagus
passes between the connectives of the nerve-cord. Not a few
other animals, such as Annelids and Mollusca, exhibit the same
arrangement.</p>

<p>Arthropoda are not known to be ciliated in any part of the
body, or in any stage of growth. Another histological peculiarity,
not quite so universal, is the striation of the muscular
fibres throughout the body. In many Invertebrates there are
no striated muscles at all, while in Vertebrates only voluntary
muscles, as a rule, are striated.</p>

<p>The circulatory organs of Arthropoda vary greatly in plan
and degree of complication, but there is never a completely
closed circulation.</p>

<p>The development of Arthropoda may be accompanied by
striking metamorphosis, <i>e.g.</i>, in many marine Crustacea, but, as
in other animals, the terrestrial and fluviatile forms usually
develop directly. Even in Insects, which appear to contradict
this rule flatly, the exception is more apparent than real. The
Insect emerges from the egg as a fully formed larva, and so far
its development is direct. It is the full-grown larva, however,
which corresponds most nearly to the adult Myriopod, while the
pupa and imago are stages peculiar to the Insect. It is not by
any process of embryonic development, but by a secondary
metamorphosis of the adult that the Insect acquires the power
of flight necessary for the deposit of eggs in a new site.</p>

<h3><i>Characters of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>Insects are distinguished from other Arthropoda by the
arrangement of the segments of the body into three plainly
marked regions&mdash;head, thorax, and abdomen; by the three
pairs of ambulatory legs carried upon the thorax; by the single
pair of antennæ; and by the tracheal respiration. Myriopods
and Arachnida have no distinct thorax. Most Crustacea have
two pairs of antennæ, while in Arachnida antennæ are wanting
altogether. Crustacea, if they possess special respiratory organs
at all, have branchiæ (gills) in place of tracheæ (air-tubes). In
Arachnida, Myriopoda, and Crustacea there are usually more
than three pairs of ambulatory legs in the adult.</p>

<p>The appendages of an Insect’s head (antennæ, mandibles,
maxillæ) are appropriated to special senses, or to the operations
of feeding, and have lost that obvious correspondence with
walking legs which they still retain in some lower Arthropoda
(<i>Peripatus</i>, <i>Limulus</i>, <i>Arachnida</i>). The thorax consists of <span class="nowrap">three<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>
segments, each of which carries a pair of ambulatory legs. No
abdominal legs are found in any adult insect. The middle
thoracic segment may carry a pair of wings or wing-covers, and
the third segment a pair of wings.</p>

<p>The lower or less-specialised Insects, such as the Cockroach,
have nearly as many nerve-ganglia as segments, and the longitudinal
connectives of the nerve-cord are double. In the adult
of certain higher <span class="nowrap">Insects<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> (<i>e.g.</i>, many Coleoptera, and some
Diptera) the nerve-ganglia are concentrated, reduced in number,
and restricted to the head and thorax; while all the connectives,
except those of the œsophageal ring, may be outwardly
single.</p>

<p>The heart, or dorsal vessel, is subdivided by constrictions
into a series of chambers, from which an aorta passes forwards
to the head.</p>

<p>Air is usually taken into the body by stigmata or breathing-pores<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
which lie along the sides of the thorax and abdomen.<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
It circulates through repeatedly-branching tracheal tubes, whose
lining is strengthened by a spiral coil. Air-sacs (dilated portions
of the air-tubes) occur in Insects of powerful flight.</p>

<p>The generative organs are placed near the hinder end of the
body<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> Most Insects are oviparous<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> The sexes are always distinct;
but imperfect females (“neuters”) occur in some kinds
of social Insects. Agamogenesis (reproduction by unfertilised
eggs) is not uncommon.</p>


<h3><i>Orders of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The orders of Insects are usually defined with reference to
the degree of metamorphosis and the structure of the parts of
the mouth. Five of the orders (3, 5–8) in the table on page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_9">9</a>
undergo complete metamorphosis, and during the time of most
rapid change the insect is motionless. In the remaining orders
(1, 2, 4) there is either no metamorphosis (<i>Thysanura</i>), or it is
incomplete&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the insect is active in all stages of growth.
Among these three orders we readily distinguish the minute and
wingless Thysanura. Two orders remain, in which the adult is
commonly provided with wings; of these, the Orthoptera have
biting jaws, the Hemiptera, jaws adapted for piercing and
sucking.</p>

<p>The name of Black Beetle, often given to the Cockroach, is
therefore technically wrong. True Beetles have a resting or
chrysalis stage, and may further be recognised in the adult state
by the dense wing-covers, meeting along a straight line down
the middle of the back, and by the transversely folded wings.
Cockroaches have no resting stage, the wing-covers overlap, and
the wings fold up fan-wise.</p>


<h3><i>Further Definition of Cockroaches.</i></h3>

<p>In the large order of Orthoptera, which includes Earwigs,
Praying Insects, Walking Sticks, Grasshoppers, Locusts,
Crickets, White Ants, Day-flies, and Dragon-flies, the family of
Cockroaches is defined as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Family <i>Blattina</i>. Body usually depressed, oval. Pronotum
shield-like. Legs adapted for running only. Wing-covers
usually leathery, opaque, overlapping (if well
developed) when at rest, anal area defined by a furrow
(fig.&nbsp;4). Head declivent, or sloped backwards, retractile
beneath the pronotum. Eyes large, ocelli rudimentary,
usually two, antennæ long and slender.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 4.&mdash;Generalised sketch of Cockroach wing-cover.</p></div>
</div>

<p>About eight hundred species of Cockroaches have been
defined, and to facilitate their arrangement, three groups have
been proposed, under which the different genera are ranked<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Group 1. Both sexes wingless (<i>Polyzosteria</i>).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Group 2. Males winged, females wingless (<i>Perisphæria</i>,
<i>Heterogamia</i>).</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Group 3. Both sexes with more or less developed wings
(about 7 genera).</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span></p>
<p>In Group 3 occur the only two genera which we shall find it
necessary to describe&mdash;viz., <i>Blatta</i>, which includes the European
Cockroaches, and <i>Periplaneta</i>, to which belong the Cockroaches
of tropical Asia and America.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Genus <i>Blatta</i>. A pulvillus between the claws of the feet.

<p>Genus <i>Periplaneta</i>. Readily distinguished from Blatta by

<h3><i>Range.</i></h3>

<p>The common Cockroach is native to tropical Asia<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> and long
ago made its way by the old trade-routes to the Mediterranean
countries. At the end of the sixteenth century it appears to
have got access to England and Holland, and has gradually
spread thence to every part of the world.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first mention of this insect in zoological literature
occurs in Moufet’s Insectorum Theatrum (1634), where he
speaks of the Blattæ as occurring in wine cellars, flour mills, &amp;c.,
in England. It is hard to determine in all cases of what insects
he is speaking, since one of his rude woodcuts of a “Blatta” is
plainly <i>Blaps mortisaga</i>; another is, however, recognisable as
the female of <i>P. orientalis</i>; a third, more doubtfully, as the male
of the same species. He tells how Sir Francis Drake took the
ship “Philip,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> laden with spices, and found a great multitude
of winged Blattæ on board, “which were a little larger, softer,
and darker than ours.” Perhaps these belonged to the American
species, but the description is obscure. Swammerdam also was
acquainted with our Cockroach as an inhabitant of Holland
early in the seventeenth century. He speaks of it as <span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>“insectum
illud Indicum, sub nomine Kakkerlak satis notum,” and very
properly distinguishes from it “the species of Scarabæus”
(<i>Blaps</i>), which Moufet had taken for a Blatta<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>The American Cockroach is native to tropical America, but
has now become widely spread by commerce. An Australian
species also (<i>P. australasiæ</i>) has begun to extend its native
limits, having been observed in Sweden<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> Belgium, Madeira,
the East and West Indies<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> Florida<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> &amp;c. In Florida it is said
to be the torment of housekeepers.</p>

<p>To the genus <i>Blatta</i> belong a number of small European
species, which mostly lurk in woods and thickets. Some of
these are found in the south of England. <i>B. lapponica</i> is one of
the commonest and most widely distributed. It is smaller than
the common Cockroach, and both sexes have long wings and
wing-cases. The males are black and the females yellow. It is
found on the mountains of Norway and Switzerland as high as
shrubs extend, and when sheltered by human dwellings, can
endure the extreme cold of the most northern parts of Europe.
This is the insect of which Linnæus tells, that in company with
<i>Silpha lapponica</i> it has been known to devour in one day the
whole stock of dried but unsalted fish of a Lapland village.
<i>B. germanica</i> also has the wings and wing-cases well developed
in both sexes. Two longitudinal stripes on the pronotum, or
first dorsal plate of the thorax, are the readiest mark of this
species, which is smaller and lighter in colour than the common
Cockroach. It is plentiful in most German towns, and has been
introduced from Germany into many other countries<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> but it
appears to be native, not to Germany alone, but to Asia and all
parts of central and southern Europe. Where and how it first
became domesticated we do not know.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>
<p>The other species of Cockroaches which have been met with
in Europe are <i>Panchlora maderæ</i>, said by Stephens to be occasionally
seen in London, and <i>Blabera gigantea</i> the Drummer of
the West Indies, which has often been found alive in ships in
the London Docks.</p>

<p><i>Blatta germanica</i>, <i>Periplaneta orientalis</i>, and <i>P. americana</i>, are
so similar in habits and mode of life as to be interchangeable,
and each is known to maintain itself in particular houses or
towns within the territory of another species, though usually
without spreading.</p>

<p><i>Orientalis</i> is, for example, the common Cockroach of England,
but <i>germanica</i> frequently gets a settlement and remains long in
the same quarters. H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R., in Science-Gossip for 1868, p.&nbsp;15,
speaks of it as swarming in an hotel near Covent Garden, where
it can be traced back as far as 1857. In Leeds, one baker’s
shop is infested by this species; it is believed to have been
brought by soldiers to the barracks, after the Crimean war, and
to have been carried to the baker’s in bread-baskets. We have
met with no instance in which it has continued to gain ground
at the expense of <i>orientalis</i>. <i>Americana</i> also seems well established
in particular houses or districts in England. H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;R.
(loc. cit.) mentions warehouses near the Thames, Red Lion and
Bloomsbury Squares, and the Zoological Gardens, Regent’s
Park. It frequents one single warehouse in Bradford, and is
similarly local in other towns with foreign trade.</p>

<p>Many cases are recorded in which <i>germanica</i> has been replaced
by <i>orientalis</i>, as in parts of Russia and Western Germany, but
detailed and authenticated accounts are still desired. On the
whole <i>orientalis</i> seems to be dominant over both <i>germanica</i> and
<i>americana</i>.</p>

<p>The slow spread of the Cockroaches in Europe is noteworthy,
not as exceptional among invading species, but as one more
illustration of the length of time requisite for changes of the
equilibrium of nature. It took two centuries from the first
introduction of <i>orientalis</i> into England for it to spread far from
London. Gilbert White, writing, as it would appear, at some
date before 1790, speaks of the appearance of “an unusual
insect,” which proved to be the Cockroach, at Selborne, and
says: <span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>“How long they have abounded in England I cannot say;
but have never observed them in my house till lately.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> It is
probable that many English villages are still clear of the pest.
The House Cricket, which the Cockroaches seem destined to
supplant, still dwells in our houses, often side by side with its
rival, sharing the same warm crannies, and the same food. The
other imported species, though there is reason to suppose that
they cannot permanently withstand <i>orientalis</i>, are by no means
beaten out of the field; they retreat slowly where they retreat
at all, and display inferiority chiefly in this, that in countries
where both are found, they do not spread, while their competitor
does. It may yet require some centuries to settle the petty wars
of the Cockroaches.</p>

<p>It is also worth notice that in this, as in most other cases, the
causes of such dominance over the rest as one species enjoys are
very hard to discover. We cannot explain what peculiarities
enable Cockroaches to invade ground thoroughly occupied by
the House Cricket, an insect of quite similar mode of life:
and it is equally hard to account for the superiority of <i>orientalis</i>
over the other species. It is neither the largest nor the smallest;
it is not perceptibly more prolific, or more voracious, or fonder
of warmth, or swifter than its rivals, nor is it easy to see how
the one conspicuous structural difference—viz., the rudimentary
state of the wings of the female, can greatly favour <i>orientalis</i>.
Some slight advantage seems to lie in characteristics too subtle
for our detection or comprehension.</p>


<h3><i>Food and Habits.</i></h3>

<p>As to the food of Cockroaches, we can hardly except any
animal or vegetable substance from the long list of their depredations.
Bark, leaves, the pith of living cycads, paper, woollen
clothes, sugar, cheese, bread, blacking, oil, lemons, ink, flesh,
fish, leather, the dead bodies of other Cockroaches, their own
cast skins and empty egg-capsules, all are greedily consumed.
Cucumber, too, they will eat, though it disagrees with them
horribly.</p>

<p>In the matter of temperature they are less easy to please.
They are extremely fond of warmth, lurking in nooks near the<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
oven, and abounding in bakehouses, distilleries, and all kinds of
factories which provide a steady heat together with a supply of
something eatable. Cold is the only check, and an unwarmed
room during an English winter is more than they can endure.
They are strictly nocturnal, and shun the light, although when
long unmolested they become bolder. The flattened body
enables the Cockroach to creep into very narrow crevices, and
during cold weather it takes refuge beneath the flags of a
kitchen floor, or in other very confined spaces.</p>

<p>The Cockroach belongs to a miscellaneous group of animals,
which may be described as in various degrees parasitic upon
men. These are all in a vague sense domestic species, but have
not, like the ox, sheep, goat, or pig, been forcibly reduced to
servitude; they have rather attached themselves to man in
various degrees of intimacy. The dog has slowly won his place
as our companion; the cat is tolerated and even caressed, but
her attachment is to the dwelling and not to us; the jackal and
rat are scavengers and thieves; the weasel, jackdaw, and magpie
are wild species which show a slight preference for the neighbourhood
of man. All of these, except the cat, which holds a
very peculiar place, possess in a considerable degree qualities
which bring success in the great competitive examination.
They are not eminently specialised, their diet is mixed, their
range as natural species is wide. Apart from man, they would
have become numerous and strong, but those qualities which fit
them so well to shift for themselves, have had full play in the
dwellings of a wealthy and careless host. Of these domestic
parasites at least two are insects, the House-fly and the Cockroach;
and the Cockroach in particular is eminent in its peculiar
sphere of activity. The successful competition of Cockroaches
with other insects under natural conditions is sufficiently proved
by the fact that about nine hundred species have already been
described<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> while their rapid multiplication and almost worldwide
dissemination in the dwellings of man is an equally
striking proof of their versatility and readiness to adapt themselves
to artificial circumstances. In numerical frequency they<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
probably exceed all domestic animals of larger size, while in
geographical range the five species, <i>lapponica</i>, <i>germanica</i>,
<i>orientalis</i>, <i>americana</i>, and <i>australasiæ</i>, are together comparable to
the dog or pig, which have been multiplied and transported by
man for his own purposes, and which cover the habitable globe.</p>


<h3><i>The Cockroach a persistent type.</i></h3>

<p>The Cockroach is historically one of the most ancient, and
structurally one of the most primitive, of our surviving insects.
Its immense antiquity is shown by the fact that so many Cockroaches
have been found in the Coal Measures, where about
eighty species have been met with. The absence of well-defined
stages of growth, such as the soft-bodied larva or inactive pupa,
the little specialised wings and jaws, the simple structure of the
thorax, the jointed appendages carried on the end of the
abdomen, and the unconcentrated nervous system, are marks of
the most primitive insect-types. The order Orthoptera is undeniably
the least specialised among winged insects at least, and
within this order none are more simple in structure, or reach
farther back in the geological record than the Cockroaches.
The wingless Thysanura are even more generalised, but their
geological history is illegible<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Life-History.</i></h3>

<p>The eggs of the Cockroach are laid sixteen together in a
large horny capsule. This capsule is oval, with roundish ends,
and has a longitudinal serrated ridge, which is uppermost while
in position within the body of the female. The capsule is
formed by the secretion of a “colleterial” gland, poured out
upon the inner surface of a chamber (vulva) into which the
oviducts lead. The secretion is at first fluid and white, but
hardens and turns brown on exposure to the air. In this way a
sort of mould of the vulva is formed, which is hollow, and opens
forwards towards the outlet of the common oviduct. Eggs are<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
now passed one by one into the capsule; and as it becomes full,
its length is gradually increased by fresh additions, while the
first-formed portion begins to protrude from the body of the
female. When sixteen eggs have descended, the capsule is
closed in front, and after an interval of seven or eight days, is
dropped in a warm and sheltered crevice. In <i>Periplaneta
orientalis</i> it measures about ·45&nbsp;in. by ·25&nbsp;in. (fig.&nbsp;5). The ova
develop within the capsule, and when ready to escape are of
elongate-oval shape, resembling mummies in their wrappings.
Eight embryos in one row face eight others on the opposite side,
being alternated for close packing. Their ventral surfaces,
which are afterwards turned towards the ground, are opposed,
and their rounded dorsal surfaces are turned towards the wall of
capsule; their heads are all directed towards the serrated edge.
The ripe embryos are said by Westwood to discharge a fluid
(saliva?) which softens the cement along the dorsal edge, and
enables them to escape from their prison. In <i>Blatta germanica</i>
the female is believed to help in the process of extrication<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>
The larvæ are at first white, with black eyes, but soon darken.
They run about with great activity, feeding upon any starchy
food which they can find.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 5.&mdash;Egg-capsule of <i>P. orientalis</i> (magnified). A, external view;
B, opened; C, end view.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The larvæ of the Cockroach hardly differ outwardly from the
adult, except in the absence of wings. The tenth tergum is
notched in both sexes, as in the adult female. The sub-anal
styles of the male are developed in the larva.</p>

<p>Cornelius, in his Beiträge zur nähern Kenntniss von Periplaneta
orientalis (1853), gives the following account of the moults<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
of the Cockroach. The first change of skin occurs immediately
after escape from the egg-capsule, the second four weeks later,
the third at the end of the first year, and each succeeding moult
after a year’s interval. At the sixth moult the insect becomes
a pupa<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> and at the seventh (being now four years old) it
assumes the form of the perfect Insect. The changes of skin
are annual, and like fertilisation and oviposition, take place in
the summer months only. He tells us further that the ova
require about a year for their development. These statements
are partly based upon observation of captive Cockroaches, and
are the only ones accessible; but they require confirmation by
independent observers, especially as they altogether differ from
Hummel’s account of the life-history of <i>Blatta germanica</i>, and
are at variance with the popular belief that new generations of
the Cockroach are produced with great rapidity.</p>

<p>The antennæ of the male nymph resemble those of the adult
female. Wings and wing-covers appear first in the later larval<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
stages, but are then rudimentary, and constitute a mere prolongation
of the margins of the thoracic rings. Cornelius says
that the round white spot internal to the antenna first appears
plainly in the pupa, but we have readily found it in a very
young larva. The Insect is active in all its stages, and is
therefore, with other Orthoptera, described as undergoing
“incomplete metamorphosis.” After each moult it is for a few
hours nearly pure white. Of the duration of life in this species
we have no certain information, and there is great difficulty in
procuring any.</p>


<h3><i>Sexual Differences.</i></h3>

<p>Male Cockroaches are readily distinguished from the females
by the well-developed wings and wing-covers. They are also
slighter and weaker than the females; their terga and sterna
are not so much thickened; their alimentary canal is more
slender, and they feed less greedily (the crop of the male is
usually only half-full of food). They stand higher on their legs
than the females, whose abdomen trails on the ground. The
external anatomical differences of the sexes may be tabulated
<span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3><i>Parasites.</i></h3>

<p>We have before us a long list of <span class="nowrap">parasites<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> which infest the
Cockroach. There is a conferva, an amœba, several infusoria,
nematoid worms (one of which migrates to and fro between the
rat and the Cockroach), a mite, as well as hymenopterous and
coleopterous Insects. The Cockroach has a still longer array of
foes, which includes monkeys, hedgehogs, pole-cats, cats, rats,
birds, chamæleons, frogs, and wasps, but no single friend, unless
those are reckoned as friends which are the foes of its foes.</p>


<h3><i>Names in common use.</i></h3>

<p>A few lines must be added upon the popular and scientific
names of this insect. Etymologists have found it hard to
explain the common English name, which seems to be related to<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
<i>cock</i> and <i>roach</i>, but has really nothing to do with either. The
lexicographers usually hold their peace about it, or give derivations
which are absurd. Mr. James M. Miall informs us that
“<i>Cockroach</i> can be traced to the Spanish <i>cucarácha</i>, a diminutive
form of <i>cuco</i> or <i>coco</i> (Lat. <i>coccum</i>, a berry). <i>Cucarácha</i> is used
also of the woodlouse, which, when rolled up, resembles a berry.
The termination <i>-ácha</i> (Ital. <i>-accio</i>, <i>-accia</i>) signifies <i>mean</i> or
<i>contemptible</i>. The Spanish word has also taken a French form;
at least <i>coqueraches</i> has some currency (see, for example, Tylor’s
Anahuac, p.&nbsp;325).” In provincial English <i>Black Clock</i> is a common
name. The German word <i>Schabe</i>, often turned into
<i>Schwabe</i>, means perhaps <i>Suabian</i>, as Moufet, quoting Cordus,
seems to explain<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> <i>Franzose</i> and <i>Däne</i> are other German words
for the insect, applied specially to <i>Blatta germanica</i>; and all
seem to imply some popular theory as to the native country of
the Cockroach<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> This etymology of <i>Schabe</i> is not free from
suspicion, particularly as the same term is commonly applied to
the clothes-moth. <i>Kakerlac</i>, much used in France and French-speaking
colonies, is a Dutch word of unknown signification.
<i>P. Americana</i> is usually named <i>Kakerlac</i> or <i>Cancrelat</i> by the
French; while <i>orientalis</i> has many names, such as <i>Cafard</i>, <i>Ravet</i>,
and <i>Bête noire</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> The name <i>Blatta</i> was applied by the ancients
to quite different insects, of which Virgil and Pliny make
mention; <i>Periplaneta</i> is a modern generic term, coined by
Burmeister.</p>


<h3><i>Uses.</i></h3>

<p>Of the uses to which Cockroaches have been put we have
little to say. They constitute a popular remedy for dropsy in
Russia, and both cockroach-tea and cockroach-pills are known
in the medical practice of Philadelphia. Salted Cockroaches
are said to have an agreeable flavour which is apparent in
certain popular sauces.</p>

<h3><i>Chitin.</i></h3>

<p>When the skin of an Insect is boiled successively in acids,
alkalies, alcohol, and ether, an insoluble residue known as
Chitin (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) is obtained. It may be recognised and
sufficiently separated by its resistance to boiling liquor potassæ.
Chitin forms less than one-half by weight of the integument, but
it is so coherent and uniformly distributed that when isolated
by chemical reagents, and even when cautiously calcined, it
retains its original organised form. The colour which it frequently
exhibits is not due to any essential ingredient; it may
be diminished or even destroyed by various bleaching processes.
The colouring-matter of the chitin of the Cockroach, which is
amber-yellow in thin sheets and blackish-brown in dense
masses, is particularly stable and difficult of removal. Its composition
does not appear to have been ascertained; it is white
when first secreted, but darkens on exposure to air. Fresh-<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>moulted
Cockroaches are white, but gradually darken in three
or four hours. <span class="nowrap">Lowne<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> observes that in the Blow-fly the pigment
is “first to be met with in the fat-bodies of the larvæ.
These are perfectly white, but when cut from the larva, and
exposed to the air, they rapidly assume an inky blackness<span class="ell">...</span>.
When the perfect insect emerges from the pupa, and
respiration again commences, the integument is nearly white,
or a faint ashy colour prevails. This soon gives place to the
characteristic blue or violet tint, first immediately around those
portions most largely supplied with air vessels.” Professor
<span class="nowrap">Moseley<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> tells us that, thinking it just within the limits of
possibility that the brown coloration of the Cockroach might be
due to the presence of silver, he analysed one pound weight of
Blatta. He found no silver, but plenty of iron, and a remarkable
quantity of manganese. That light has some action upon
the colouring matter seems to be indicated by the fact that in a
newly-moulted Cockroach the dorsal surface darkens first.</p>

<p>Chitin is not peculiar to Insects, nor even to Arthropoda.
The pen of cuttle-fishes and the shell of Lingula contain the
same substance<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> which is also proved, or suspected, to occur in
many other animals.</p>

<p>The chemical stability of chitin is so remarkable that we
might well expect it to accumulate like the inorganic constituents
of animal skeletons, and form permanent deposits.
<span class="nowrap">Schlossberger<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> has, however, shown that it changes slowly
under the action of water. Chitin kept for a year under water
partially dissolved, turned into a slimy mass, and gave off a
peculiar smell. This looks as if it were liable to putrefaction.
The minute proportion of nitrogen in its composition may
explain the complete disappearance of chitin in nature.</p>


<h3><i>The Chitinous Cuticle.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a id="Fig_8"></a><img src="images/i_p030.jpg" width="250" height="260" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 8.&mdash;Diagram of Insect integument, in section. <i>bm</i>, basement membrane;
<i>hyp</i>, hypodermis, or chitinogenous layer; <i>ct</i>, <i>ct</i>′, chitinous cuticle; <i>s</i>, a seta.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The chitinous exoskeleton is rather an exudation than a true
tissue. It is not made up of cells, but of many superposed<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
laminæ, secreted by an underlying epithelium, or “chitinogenous
layer.” This consists of a single layer of flattened cells,
resting upon a basement membrane. A cross-section of the
chitinous layer, or “cuticle,” examined with a high power
shows extremely close and fine lines perpendicular to the laminæ.
The cells commonly form a mosaic pattern, as if altered in
shape by mutual pressure. The free surface of the integument
of the Cockroach is divided into polygonal, raised spaces. Here
and there an unusually long, flask-shaped, epithelial cell projects
through the cuticle, and forms for itself an elongate chitinous
sheath, commonly articulated at the base; such hollow sheaths
form the hairs or setæ of Insects&mdash;structures quite different
histologically from the hairs of Vertebrates.</p>

<p>The polygonal areas of the cuticle correspond each to a
chitinogenous cell. Larger areas, around which the surrounding
ones are radiately grouped, are discerned at intervals, and these
carry hairs, or give attachment to muscular fibres.</p>

<p>Viallanes (loc. cit.) has added some interesting details to what
was previously known of Insect-hairs. There are, he points
out, two kinds of hairs, distinguished by their size and structure.
The smaller spring from the boundary between contiguous
polygonal areas, and have no sensory character. The larger
ones occupy unusually large areas, surmount chitinogenous cells
of corresponding size, and receive a special nervous supply.<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
The <span class="nowrap">nerve<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> expands at the base of the hair into a spindle-shaped,
nucleated mass (bipolar ganglion-cell), from which issues
a filament which traverses the axis of the hair, piercing the
chitinogenous cell, whose protoplasm surrounds it with a sheath
which is continued to the tip of the hair. Such sensory hairs
are abundant in parts which are endowed with special sensibility.</p>

<p>The chitinous cuticle is often folded in so as to form a deep
pit, which, looked at from the inside of the body, resembles a
lever, or a hook. Such inward-directed processes serve chiefly
for the attachment of muscles, and are termed <i>apodemes</i> (<i>apodemata</i>).
A simple example is afforded by the two glove-tips
which lie in the middle line of the under-surface of the thorax
(p.&nbsp;58, and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_27">27</a>). In other cases the pit is closed from the<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
first, and the apodeme is formed in the midst of a group of
chitinogenous cells distant from the superficial layer, though
continuous therewith. Many tendons of insertion are formed
in this way. The two forked processes in the floor of the thorax
(p.&nbsp;58, and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_27">27</a>) are unusually large and complex structures of
the same kind. In the tentorium of the head (p.&nbsp;39, and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_17">17</a>)
a pair of apodemes are supposed to unite and form an extensive
platform which supports the brain and gullet.</p>

</div>

<p>Like other Arthropoda, Insects shed their chitinous cuticle
from time to time. A new cuticle, at first soft and colourless, is
previously secreted, and from it the old one gradually becomes
detached. The setæ probably serve the same purpose as the
“casting-hairs” described by Braun in the crayfish, and by
Cartier in certain reptiles<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> that is, they mechanically loosen the
old skin by pushing beneath it. In many soft-bodied nymphs
the new skin can be gathered up into a multitude of fine
wrinkles, which facilitate separation, but we have not found
such wrinkles in the Cockroach, except in the wings. The
integument about to be shed splits along the back of the
Cockroach, from the head to the end of the thorax<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> and the
animal draws its limbs out of their discarded sheaths with much
effort. It is remarkable that the long, tapering, and many-jointed
antennæ are drawn out from an entire sheath. At the<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
same time the chitinous lining of the tracheal tubes is cast,
while that of the alimentary canal is broken up and passed
through the body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 190px;">

</div>

<p>Prolonged boiling in caustic potash, though it dissolves the
viscera, does not disintegrate the exoskeleton. This shows that
the segments of the integument are not separate chitinous
rings, but thickenings of a continuous chitinous investment.
Nevertheless, their constancy in position and their conformity
in structure often enable us to trace homologies between different
segments and different species as certainly as between corresponding
elements of the osseous vertebrate skeleton.</p>


<h3><i>Parts of a Somite.</i></h3>

<p>Audouin’s laborious researches into the exoskeleton of <span class="nowrap">Insects<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
resulted in a nomenclature which has been generally adopted.
He divides each somite (segment) into eight pieces, grouped in
pairs&mdash;viz., <i>terga</i> (dorsal plates), <i>sterna</i> (ventral plates), <i>epimera</i>
(adjacent to the terga), and <i>episterna</i> (adjacent to the sterna).</p>

<p>While admitting the usefulness of these terms, we must warn
the reader not to suppose that this subdivision is either normal
or primitive. The eight-parted segment exists in no single<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
larval or adult Arthropod. Lower forms and younger stages
take us further from such a type, instead of nearer to it; and
Audouin’s theoretical conception is most fully realised in the
thorax of an adult Insect with well-developed legs and wings.</p>

<p>The morphologist would derive all the varieties of Arthropod
segments from the very simple and uniform chitinous cuticle
found in Annelids and many Insect-larvæ. This becomes
differentiated by unequal thickening and folding in, and a series
of rings connected by flexible membranes is produced. Locomotive
and respiratory activity commonly lead to the definition
of terga and sterna, which are similarly attached to each other
by flexible membranes. A pair of limbs may next be inserted
between the terga and sterna, and the simple segment thus
composed occurs so extensively in the less modified regions
and in early stages that it may well be considered the typical
Arthropod somite.</p>

<p>Special needs may lead to the division of the sterna into
lateral halves, but this is purely an adaptive change. The
third thoracic sternum of the male Cockroach, and the second
and third of the female are thus divided, as is also the hinder
part of the seventh abdominal sternum of the female.</p>

<p>In an early stage every somite has its tergal region divided
into lateral halves, owing to the late completion of the body on
this side. Traces of this division may survive even in the
imago. There is often a conspicuous dorsal groove in the
thoracic terga, and at the time of moult the terga split along
an accurately median line (see fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>Additional pieces may be developed between the terga and
sterna, and these have long been termed <i>pleural</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> There may
be, for example, single stigmatic plates, as in the abdomen of
the Cockroach, pieces to support the thoracic legs, and pieces to
support the wings; but the number and position of these plates
depends upon their immediate use, and their homologies become
very uncertain when Insects of different orders are compared.
In general, the pleural elements of the segment are late in
development, variable, and highly adaptive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p>

<h3><i>Somites of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>The exoskeleton of the Cockroach is divisible into about
seventeen segments, which are grouped into three regions, as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal" rowspan="2">Head&nbsp;</td><td class="tal pt03" rowspan="2"><img src="images/27x6bl.png" width="6" height="27" alt="" /></td><td class="tal">Procephalic lobes</td><td class="tar pl1" rowspan="2">&nbsp;3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post-oral segments&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal" colspan="3">Thorax</td><td class="tar pl1 vab">&nbsp;3</td><td><span class="ilb"><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="tar pl1"><span class="ilb">17</span></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td class="tar pl1">&mdash;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It is a strong argument in favour of this estimate that many
Insects, at the time when segmentation first appears, possess
seventeen segments<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> The procephalic lobes, from which a great
part of the head, including the antennæ, is developed, are often
counted as an additional segment<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span></p>

<p>The limbs, which in less specialised Arthropoda are carried
with great regularity on every segment of the body, are greatly
reduced in Insects. Those borne by the head are converted into
sensory and masticatory organs; those on the abdomen are
either totally suppressed, or extremely modified, and only the
thoracic limbs remain capable of aiding in locomotion.</p>

<p>The primitive structure of the Arthropod limb is adapted to
locomotion in water, and persists, with little modification, in
most Crustacea. Here we find in most of the <span class="nowrap">appendages<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> a
basal stalk (<i>protopodite</i>), often two-jointed, an inner terminal
branch (<i>endopodite</i>), and an outer terminal branch (<i>exopodite</i>),
each of the latter commonly consisting of several joints. It
does not appear that the appendages of Insects conform to the
biramous Crustacean type, though the ends of the maxillæ are
often divided into an outer and an inner portion.</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to describe, in some detail, the regions
of the body of the adult Cockroach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Head; Central Parts.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">
<a id="Fig_13"></a><img src="images/i_p036.jpg" width="220" height="265" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 13.&mdash;Front of Head. ×&nbsp;10.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The head of the Cockroach, as seen from the front, is pear-shaped,
having a semi-circular outline above, and narrowing
downwards. A side-view shows that the front and back are
flattish, while the top and sides are regularly rounded. In the
living animal the face is usually inclined downwards, but it can
be tilted till the lower end projects considerably forward. The
mouth, surrounded by gnathites or jaws, opens below. On the
hinder surface is the occipital foramen, by which the head communicates
with the thorax. A rather long neck allows the
head to be retracted beneath the pronotum (first dorsal shield
of the thorax) or protruded beyond it.</p>

<p>On the front of the head we observe the clypeus, which
occupies a large central tract, extending almost completely
across the widest part of the face. It is divided above by a
sharply bent suture from the two epicranial plates, which form
the top of the head as well as a great part of its back and sides.
The labrum hangs like a flap from its lower edge. A little
above the articulation of the labrum the width of the clypeus is
suddenly reduced, as if a squarish piece had been cut out of
each lower corner. In the re-entrant angle so formed, the
ginglymus, or anterior articulation of the mandible, is situated.</p>

<p>The labrum is narrower than the clypeus, and of squarish
shape, the lower angles being rounded. It hangs downwards,<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
with a slight inclination backwards towards the mouth, whose
front wall it forms. On each side, about halfway between the
lateral margin and the middle line, the posterior surface of the
labrum is strengthened by a vertical chitinous slip set with
large setæ. Each of these plates passes above into a ring, from
the upper and outer part of which a short lever passes upwards,
and gives attachment to a muscle (<i>levator menti</i>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="Fig_14"></a><img src="images/i_p037a.jpg" width="200" height="121" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 14.&mdash;Top of Head. <i>ep</i>, epi­cra­nial plate; <i>oc</i>, eye; <i>ge</i>, gena. ×&nbsp;10.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The top and back of the head are defended by the two
epicranial plates, which meet along the middle line, but diverge
widely as they descend upon the posterior surface, thus enclosing
a large opening, the occipital foramen. Beyond the foramen,
they pass still further downwards, their inner edges receding in
a sharp curve from the vertical line, and end below in cavities
for the articulation of the mandibular condyles<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span></p>

<p>The sides of the head are completed by the eyes and the
genæ. The large compound eye is bounded above by the
epicranium; in front by a narrow band which connects the
epicranium with the clypeus; behind, by the gena. The gena
passes downwards between the eye and the epicranial plate,
then curves forwards beneath the eye, and just appears upon
the front of the face, being loosely connected at this point with
the clypeus. Its lower edge overlaps the base of the mandible,
and encloses the extensor mandibulæ.</p>

<p>The occipital foramen has the form of an heraldic shield. Its
lateral margin is strengthened by a rim continuous with the
tentorium, or internal skeleton of the head. Below, the foramen
is completed by the upper edge of the tentorial plate,
which nearly coincides with the upper edge of the submentum
(basal piece of the second pair of maxillæ); a cleft, however,
divides the two, through which nerve-commissures pass from
the sub-œsophageal to the first thoracic ganglion. Through the
occipital foramen pass the œsophagus, the salivary ducts, the
aorta, and the tracheal tubes for the supply of air to the head.</p>

</div>

<p>The internal skeleton of the head consists of a nearly transparent
chitinous septum, named <i>tentorium</i> by Burmeister, which
extends downwards and forwards from the lower border of the<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
occipital foramen. In front it gives off two long crura, or
props, which pass to the ginglymus, and are reflected thence
upon the inner surface of the clypeus, ascending as high as the
antennary socket, round which they form a kind of rim. Each
crus is twisted, so that the front surface becomes first internal
and then posterior as it passes towards the clypeus. The form
of the tentorium is in other respects readily understood from
the figure (fig.&nbsp;17). Its lower surface is strengthened by a
median keel which gives attachment to muscles. The œsophagus
passes upwards between its anterior crura, the long flexor of the
mandible lies on each side of the central plate; the supra-œsophageal
ganglion rests on the plate above, and the sub-œsophageal
ganglion lies below it, the nerve-cords which unite
the two passing through the circular aperture. A similar
internal chitinous skeleton occurs in the heads of other Orthoptera,
as well as in Neuroptera and Lepidoptera. <span class="nowrap">Palmén<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> thinks
that it represents a pair of stigmata or spiracles, which have
thus become modified for muscular attachment, their respiratory
function being wholly lost. In Ephemera he finds that the
tentorium breaks across the middle when the skin is changed,
and each half is drawn out from the head like the chitinous
lining of a tracheal tube.</p>

<h3><i>Antennæ; Eyes.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 190px;">
<a id="Fig_18"></a><img src="images/i_p040.jpg" width="190" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 18.&mdash;Base of Antenna of Male (to left) and Fe­male (to right). ×&nbsp;24.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A pair of antennæ spring from the front of the head. In the
male of the common Cockroach they are a little longer than
the body; in the female rather shorter. From seventy-five
to ninety joints are usually found, and the three basal joints are
larger than the rest. Up to about the thirtieth, the joints are
about twice as wide as long; from this point they become more
elongate. The joints are connected by flexible membranes, and
provided with stiff, forward-directed bristles. The ordinary
position of the antennæ is forwards and outwards.</p>

<p>Each antenna is attached to a relatively large socket (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_15">15</a>),
which lies between the epicranium and clypeus, to the front and
inner side of the compound eyes. A flexible membrane unites
the antenna to the margin of the socket, from the lower part of
which a chitinous pin projects upwards and supports the basal
joint.</p>

<p>It is well known that in many Crustacea two pairs of antennæ
are developed, the foremost pair (antennules) bearing two complete
filaments. Some writers have suggested that both pairs
may be present in Insects, though not simultaneously, the
Crustacean antennule being found in the larva, and the Crustacean
antenna in the adult. This view was supported by the<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
familiar fact that in many larvæ the antennæ are placed further
forward than in the adult. The three large joints at the base
of Orthopterous antennæ have been taken to correspond with
those of Crustacean antennules, and it has been inferred that in
Insects with incomplete metamorphosis, only antennules or
larval antennæ are developed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> This reasoning was never very
cogent, and it has been impaired by further inquiry. Weismann
has shown that in <i>Corethra plumicornis</i>, the adult antenna,
though inserted much further back than that of the larva, is
developed within it<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> and Graber has described a still more
striking case of the same thing in a White Butterfly<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> There
is, therefore, no reason to suppose that Insects possess more than
one pair of antennæ, which is probably preoral, not corresponding
with either of the Crustacean pairs.</p>

<p>We have already noticed (p.&nbsp;26) the superficial points in
which the antenna of the male Cockroach differs from that of
the female.</p>

<p>The eyes of some Crustacea are carried upon jointed appendages,
but this is never the case in Insects, though the eye-bearing
surface may project from the head, as in <i>Diopsis</i> and
<i>Stylops</i>. Professor <span class="nowrap">Huxley<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> supposes that the head of an Insect
may contain six somites, the eyes representing one pair of
appendages. The various positions in which the eyes of Arthropoda
may be developed weakens the argument drawn from the
stalk-eyed Crustacea. Claus and Fritz Müller go so far on the
other side as to deny the existence of an eye-segment even in
Crustacea.</p>


<h3><i>Mouth-parts of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>Before entering upon a full description of the mouth-parts of
the Cockroach, which present some technical difficulties, the
beginner in Insect anatomy will find it useful to get a few
points of nomenclature fixed in his memory. Unfortunately,
the terms employed by entomologists are at times neither
convenient nor philosophical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></p>

<p>There are three pairs of jaws, disposed behind the labrum, as
in the <span class="nowrap">diagram:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 19.&mdash;Diagram of Cock­roach Jaws, in hori­zon­tal sec­tion.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The mandible is undivided in all, or nearly all, Insects. Each
maxilla may consist of</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
A <i>palp</i> on the outer side,<br />
A <i>galea</i> (hood),<br />
A <i>lacinia</i> (blade), on the inner side.</p>
</div>

<p>The galea (hood) of the 3rd pair of jaws is sometimes called
the <i>paraglossa</i>.</p>

<p>A tongue-like process may be developed from the front wall
of the mouth (<i>epipharynx</i>), or from the back wall (<i>hypopharynx</i>
or <i>lingua</i>)<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> Both epipharynx and hypopharynx project into
the mouth, and, in some Diptera, far beyond it.</p>

<p>The tip of the labium is sometimes produced into a long
tongue, called the <i>ligula</i> (strap).</p>

<p>The mouths of Insects may be classed <span class="nowrap">as:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span></p>

<p>The reference of these to a common plan, and the determination
of the constituent parts, is mainly the work of Savigny.
Mouth-parts were made the basis of the classification of Insects
by Fabricius (1745–1808).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span></p>

<p>The mandibles of the Cockroach are powerful, single-<span class="nowrap">jointed<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span>
jaws, each of which is articulated by a convex “condyle” to the
lower end of the epicranial plate, and again by a concave
“ginglymus” to the clypeus. The opposable inner edges are
armed with strong tooth-like processes of dense chitin, which
interlock when the mandibles close; those towards the tip of
the mandible are sharp, while others are blunt, as if for crushing.
Each mandible can be moved through an angle of about
30°. A flexible chitinous flap extends from its inner border to
the labrum. The powerful flexor of the mandible arises within
the epicranial vault; its fibres converge to a chitinous tendon,
which passes outside the central plate of the tentorium, and at
a lower level through a fold on the lower border of the clypeus,
being finally inserted near the ginglymus. A short flexor arises
from the crus of the tentorium. The extensor muscle arises
from the side of the head, passes through the fold formed by
the lower end of the gena, and is inserted close to the outer side
of the condyle of the mandible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 20.&mdash;The Jaws, separated. <i>Mn</i>, mandible, seen from behind (to left) and front

maxil­læ. The other let­ters as be­fore. ×&nbsp;20.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The anterior maxillæ lie behind the mandibles, and like them
are unconnected with each other. They retain much more of
the primitive structure of a gnathite than the mandibles, in
which parts quite distinct in the maxillæ are condensed or
suppressed. The constituent pieces are seen in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a>. There
is a two-jointed basal piece, consisting of the <i>cardo</i> (<i>ca</i>) and the
<i>stipes</i> (<i>st</i>). The cardo is a transverse plate bent upon itself, and
enclosing muscles; it is attached to the outward-directed pedicel
of the occipital frame, and carries the vertical stipes. To the
side and lower end of the stipes is attached the five-jointed
palp (<i>pa</i>), a five-jointed limb used in feeding and in exploration,
while the lacinia (<i>la</i>) and galea (<i>ga</i>) are articulated to its
extremity. The lacinia is internal and posterior to the galea;
it is broad above, but narrows below to a bifid tooth of dense
chitin; its inner surface is beset with a cluster of strong setæ.
The galea is more flexible, and forms an irregular three-cornered<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
prism with an obliquely truncated end, upon which are many
fine hairs. A flexible and nearly transparent flap connects the
inner edges of the stipes and cardo, and joins both to the
labium. The muscles which move the bases of the maxillæ
spring from the crura, central plate, and keel of the tentorium.</p>

<p>On the posterior surface of the head, below the occipital
foramen, we find a long vertical flap, the labium, which extends
downwards to the opening of the mouth. It represents a
second pair of maxillæ, fused together in their basal half, but
retaining elsewhere sufficient resemblance to the less modified
anterior pair to permit of the identification of their component
parts. The upper edge is applied to the occipital frame, but is
neither continuous with that structure nor articulated thereto.
By stripping off the labium upwards it may be seen that it is
really continuous with the chitinous integument of the neck.
The broad shield-like base is incompletely divided by a transverse
hinge into an upper and larger piece, the <i>submentum</i>, and
a distal piece, the <i>mentum</i>. To the mentum are appended
representatives of the galeæ (here named <i>paraglossæ</i>) and laciniæ,
while a three-jointed palp with an additional basal joint (distinguished
as the <i>palpiger</i>) completes the resemblance to the
maxillæ of the first pair<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> In front of the labium, and lying
in the cavity of the mouth is a chitinous fold of the oral
integument, the <i>lingua</i>, which lies like a tongue in the floor of
the mouth. The common duct of the salivary glands enters the
lingua, and opens on its hinder surface. The lingua is supported
by the chitinous skeleton represented in the figures of the
salivary glands. (Chap. <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">vii</a>., <i>infra</i>.)</p>

<p>The epipharynx, which is a prominent part in Coleoptera and
Diptera, is not recognisable in Orthoptera.</p>


<h3><i>Functions of the Antennæ and Mouth-parts.</i></h3>

<p>We must now shortly consider the functions of the parts just
described. The antennæ have long been regarded as sense-organs,
and even the casual observer can hardly fail to remark
that they are habitually used by the Insect to gain information<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
concerning its immediate surroundings. Long antennæ, such
as those of the Cockroach, are certainly organs of touch, but it
has been much disputed whether they may not also be the seat
of some special sense, and if so, what that sense may be.
Several authors have found reason to suppose that in the Insect-antenna
resides the sense of hearing, but no evidence worth the
name is forthcoming in favour of this view. Much better
support can be found for the belief that the antenna is an
olfactory organ<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> and some experiments which seem conclusive
on this point will be cited in a later chapter.</p>

<p>In the Cockroach the mandibles and maxillæ are the only
important instruments of mastication. The labium is indirectly
concerned as completing the mouth behind and supporting the
lingua, which is possibly of importance in the ordinary operations
of feeding. <span class="nowrap">Plateau<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> has carefully described the mode of
mastication as observed in a Carabus, and his account seems to
hold good of biting Insects in general. The mandibles and
maxillæ act, as he tells us, alternately, one set closing as the
others part. The maxillæ actually push the morsel into the
buccal cavity. When the mandibles separate, the head is
slightly advanced, so that the whole action has some superficial
resemblance to that of a grazing quadruped.</p>

<p>The palps of the maxillæ and labium have been variously
regarded as sensory and masticatory instruments. Not a few
authors believe that they are useful in both ways. The question
has lately been investigated experimentally by Plateau<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> who
finds that removal of both maxillary and labial palps does not
interfere either with mastication or the choice of food. He
observes that in the various Coleoptera and Orthoptera submitted
to experiment the palps are passive while food is being
passed into the mouth.</p>

<p>Plateau’s experiments are conclusive as to the subordinate
value of the palps in feeding. The observation of live Cock<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>roaches
has satisfied us that the palps are constantly used when
the Insect is active, whether feeding or not, to explore the
surface upon which it moves. We have seen no ground for
attributing to the palps special powers of perceiving odours or
flavours, nor have we observed that they aid directly in filling
the mouth with food.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that Leydig has described and figured
in the larva of <i>Hydroporus</i> (?), and Hauser in <i>Dytiscus</i>,
<i>Carabus</i>, &amp;c., a peculiar organ, apparently sensory, which is
lodged in the maxillary and labial palps. It consists of whitish
spots, sometimes visible to the naked eye, characterised by
unusual thinness of the chitinous cuticle and by the aggregation
beneath it of a crowd of extremely minute sensory rods. Of
this organ no satisfactory explanation has yet been given<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Comparison of Mouth-parts in different Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The jaws of the Cockroach form an excellent standard of
comparison for those of other Insects, and we shall attempt to
illustrate the chief variations by referring them to this type<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span>
Mouth-parts are so extensively used in the classification of
Insects that every entomologist ought to have a rational as well
as a technical knowledge of their comparative structure. No
part of Insect anatomy affords more striking examples of
adaptive modification. In form, size, and mode of application
the jaws vary extremely. It would be hard to find feeding-organs
more unlike, at first sight, than the stylets of a Gnat and
the proboscis of a Moth, yet the study of a few well-selected
types will satisfy the observer that both are capable of derivation
from a common plan. Nor is this common plan at all
vague. It is accurately pictured in the jaws of the Cockroach
and other Orthoptera. These correspond so entirely with the
primitive arrangement, inferred by a process of abstraction from<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
the most dissimilar Insects, as to furnish a strong argument for
the descent of all higher Insects from forms not unlike Orthoptera
in the structure of their mouth-parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

Bd. XVI., taf. xxx., fig.&nbsp;30. Ref­er­ences in text. ×&nbsp;220.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Though the jaws of the Cockroach are eminently primitive
with respect to those of most other Insects, they are themselves
derived from a far simpler arrangement, which is demonstrable
in all embryonic Insects. Fig.&nbsp;21 shows an Aphis within the
egg. The rudiments of the antennæ (<i>At</i>), mandibles (<i>Mn</i>), and
maxillæ (<i>Mx<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>Mx<sup>2</sup></i>) form simple blunt projections, similar to
each other and to the future thoracic legs (<i>L<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>L<sup>3</sup></i>). We
see, therefore, that all the appendages of an Insect are similar
in an early stage of growth; and we may add that a Centipede,
a Scorpion, or a Spider would present very nearly the same
appearance in the same stage. A Crustacean in the egg would
not resemble an Insect or its own parent so closely<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Aquatic
life favours metamorphosis, and most Crustacea do not begin
life with their full quota of legs, but acquire them as they are
wanted.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="Fig_22"></a><img src="images/i_p049.jpg" width="200" height="230" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 22.&mdash;Head of larva of Goat Moth, seen from be­hind.
Cop­ied from Lyon­net.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Paired appendages of perfectly simple form are therefore the
first stage through which all Insect-jaws must pass. Our second
stage is a little more complex, and not nearly so universal as the
first. A caterpillar (fig.&nbsp;22) has its own special wants, and these
are met by the unequal development of its jaws. The mandibles
are already as complete as those of the Cockroach, which they<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
closely resemble, but the maxillæ are stunted cylinders formed
mainly of simple rings, and very like the antennæ. They show,
however, the beginnings of three processes (palp, galea, and
lacinia), which are usually conspicuous in well-developed maxillæ.
The second pair of maxillæ (<i>Lm</i>) are coalesced, as usual, and
form the spinneret. The mouth-parts of the Caterpillar do not
therefore in all respects represent a universal stage of development,
but show important adaptive modifications. The mandibles
are rapidly pushed forward, and attain their full
development in the larva; the first pair of maxillæ are temporarily
arrested in their growth, and persist for a long time in a
condition which Orthopterous embryos quickly pass through;
the maxillæ of the second pair are not only arrested in their
growth, but converted to a special use, which seems to stop all
further progress. The labial palps, indeed, which are not at all
developed in the caterpillar, survive, and become important
parts in the moth; but the greater part of the labium disappears
when the time for spinning the cocoon is over.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 23<span class="smcap">A</span>.&mdash;Diagram of Mouth-parts of Honey Bee.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We come next to the Orthopterous mouth, which is well
illustrated by the Cockroach. This is retained with little modification
in all the biting Insects (Coleoptera and Neuroptera).
The mandibles may become long and pointed, as in <i>Staphylinus</i>
and other predatory forms; in some larvæ of strong carnivorous
propensities (Ant-lion, <i>Dytiscus</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> <i>Chrysopa</i>) they are perforate at<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
the tip, and through them the juices of the prey are sucked into
the mouth, which has no other opening. The labium undergoes
marked adaptive change, without great deviation from the common
plan, in the “mask” of the larva of the Dragon-fly. This
well-known implement has a rough likeness, in the arrangement
and use of its parts, to a man’s fore-limb. The submentum
forms the arm, the mentum the fore-arm. Both these are
simple, straight pieces, connected by an elbow-joint. The hand
is wider, and carries a pair of opposable claws, the paraglossæ.
In some Coleoptera the labium is reduced to a stiff spine, while
in the Stag-beetle it is flexible and hairy, and foreshadows the
licking tongue of the Bee. The maxillæ become long and hairy
in flower-haunting Beetles, and even the mandibles are flexible
and hairy in the Scarabæus-beetles. Fritz Müller has found a
singular resemblance to the proboscis of a Moth in a species of
<i>Nemognatha</i>, where the maxillæ are transformed into two sharp
grooved bristles 12&nbsp;mm. long, which, when opposed, form a
tube, but are incapable of rolling up<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<p>In the Honey Bee (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_23">23</a>) nearly all the mouth-parts of the
Cockroach are to be made out, though some are small and others
extremely produced in length. The mandibles (<i>Mn</i>) are not
much altered, and are still used for biting, as well as for kneading
wax and other domestic work. The mandibular teeth have
proved inconvenient, and are gone. The lacinia of the maxilla
(<i>Mx</i>′) forms a broad and flexible blade, used for piercing succulent
tissues, but the galea has disappeared, and there is only a
vestige of the maxillary palp (<i>Mxp</i>). In the second pair of
maxillæ the palp (<i>Lp</i>) is prominent; its base forms a blade,
while the tip is still useful as an organ of touch. The paraglossæ
(<i>Pa</i>) can be made out, but the laciniæ are fused to form
the long, hairy tongue. This ends in a spoon-shaped lobe (not
unlike the “finger” of an elephant’s trunk), which is used both
for licking and for sucking honey.</p>

<p>The proboscis of the Bee is therefore more like a case of
instruments than a single organ. The mandibles form a strong
pair of blunt scissors. The maxillæ are used for piercing, for
stiffening and protecting the base of the tongue, and when<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
closed they form an imperfect tube outside the tongue, which,
according to Hermann Müller, is probably suctorial. The labial
palps are protective and sensory. Lastly, the central part, or
tongue, is a split tube used for suction; it is very long, so as to<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
penetrate deep flower-cups, and hairy, so that pollen may stick
to it. When the proboscis is not in use it can be slid into the
mentum (<i>M</i>), while it and the mentum together can be drawn
out of the way downwards and backwards<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span></p>

<p>In the singular suctorial mouth of Moths and Butterflies we
observe, first of all, the great development of the maxillæ.
Each forms a half-tube, which can be accurately applied to its
fellow, so as to form an efficient siphon. In many species the
two halves can be held together by a multitude of minute
hooks<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> At the base of each maxilla is a rudimentary palp

palps (<i>Lp</i>) are large and evidently important.</p>

<p>In Diptera both piercing and sucking parts are usually
present. The Gad-fly (fig.&nbsp;25) is typical. Here we recognise
the labrum (<i>Lbr</i>), mandible (<i>Mn</i>), and maxilla (<i>Mx</i>′) of the
Cockroach transformed into stylets. The maxillary palp (<i>Mxp</i>)
is still sensory. A pointed process, stiffened by chitinous ribs,
is developed from the back of the labrum. This is the
epipharynx (<i>Ep</i>), a process undeveloped in the Cockroach,
though conspicuous in some Coleoptera. All these parts are
overtopped by the suctorial labium (<i>Lm</i>), which has a two-lobed
expansion at the end. In the more specialised Diptera
this becomes a kind of cupping-glass. The Gad-fly is intermediate
between the Gnat, in which all the mouth-parts are
converted into piercing organs of extraordinary length and
sharpness, and such flies as the House-fly and Blow-fly, where
the sucking labium forms an organ of the most elaborate kind,
the piercing organs undergoing a marked reduction. Except
where the labium is short, it is doubly or trebly hinged, so that
it can be readily tucked away under the chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span></p>

<p>In Hemiptera the long four-jointed labium (<i>Lm</i>) forms a
sheath for the stylets. When not in use the whole apparatus
is drawn up beneath the head and prothorax. The mandibles
(<i>Mn</i>) are sharp at the tip, and close like a pair of forceps, enclosing
the maxillæ (<i>Mx</i>). These are of unequal length, only
one reaching the end of the mandibular case. Both have saw
teeth on the free edge. Palps are entirely wanting.</p>

<p>Comparing the four kinds of suctorial mouths, of which the
Bee, the Moth, the Fly, and the Bug furnish examples, we
observe that the sucking-tube is formed in the Moth out of the
two maxillæ, in the other three out of the labium. Of these
last the Bee has the edges of the labium turned <i>down</i>, so that
the siphon becomes <i>ventral</i>; in the Bug and Fly the edges<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
are turned <i>up</i>, and the siphon becomes <i>dorsal</i>. The more
specialised flies have the simple arrangement of the Bug complicated
by a system of branching tubes, which are probably a
special modification of the salivary duct. Similar as the
mouth-parts of the four types may be in regard to their mode
of working, they cannot be reduced to any common plan which
differs materially from that presented by the jaws of the
Cockroach.</p>


<h3><i>Composition of Head.</i></h3>

<p>In all Insects fusion of the primitive elements of the head
begins so early and is carried so far, that it is extremely difficult
to discover the precise way in which they are fitted together.
The following facts have been ascertained respecting the development
of the parts in question. At a very early stage of
embryonic life the body of the Insect becomes divided into a
series of segments, which are at fewest fourteen (in some
Diptera), while they are not known to exceed seventeen<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> Each
segment is normally provided with a pair of appendages. The
foremost segment soon enlarges beyond the rest, and becomes
divided by a median groove into two “procephalic lobes.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> Of
the appendages the first eight pairs are usually more prominent
than the rest, and of different form; those of the eighth
segment, which may be altogether inconspicuous, never attain
any functional importance. The first four pairs of appendages
are budded off from the future head, while the next three pairs
form the walking legs, and are carried upon the thoracic segments.
All the existing appendages of the fore part of the body are
thus accounted for, but the exact mode of formation of the head
has not yet been made out. The chief part of its walls, including
the clypeus, the compound eyes, and the epicranial plates,
arise from the procephalic lobes, and represent the much altered
segment of which the antennæ are the appendages. The labrum
is a secondary outgrowth from this segment, and, in some cases
at least, it originates as a pair of processes which resemble true<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
appendages, though it is unlikely that such is their real
character. No means at present exist for identifying the terga
and sterna of the head, nor have the gena, the occipital frame,
and the cervical sclerites (described below) been assigned to
their segments<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> It is worthy of notice that in the stalk-eyed
Crustacea, the head, or what corresponds to the head of Insecta,
consists of either five or six somites, taking into account a
diversity of opinion with respect to the eyestalks, while only
four pairs of appendages can be certainly traced in the head of
the Insect. The mandibles and maxillæ exist to the same
number in both groups, and are homologous organs, so far as is
known; the numerical difference relates therefore to the antennæ,
of which the Crustacean possesses two pairs, the Insect only
one. Whether the pair deficient in the Insect is altogether
undeveloped, or represented by the pair of prominences which
give rise to the labrum<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> is a question of much theoretical
interest and of not a little difficulty.</p>

<p>The following table shows the appendages of the head and
thorax in the two classes. The homologies indicated are, however,
by no means established<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Neck.</i></h3>

<p>The neck is a narrow cylindrical tube, with a flexible wall
strengthened by eight plates, the cervical sclerites, two of which
are dorsal, two ventral, and four lateral. The dorsal sclerites
lie immediately behind the head (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_14">14</a>); they are triangular,
and closely approximated to the middle line. The inferior
plates (fig.&nbsp;27) resemble segments of chitinous hoops set transversely,
one behind the other, rather behind the dorsal sclerites,
and close behind the submentum. There are two lateral
sclerites on each side of the neck (fig.&nbsp;27), a lower squarish
one, which is set diagonally, nearly meeting its fellow across
the ventral surface, and an oblong piece, closely adherent to
the other, which extends forwards and upwards towards the
dorsal side.</p>


<h3><i>Thorax.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">

</div>

<p>The elements of the thoracic exoskeleton are simpler in the
Cockroach than in Insects of powerful flight, where adaptive
changes greatly obscure the primitive arrangement. There are
three segments, each defended by a dorsal plate (<i>tergum</i>) and a
ventral plate (<i>sternum</i>). The sterna are often divided into
lateral halves. Of the three terga the first (<i>pronotum</i>) is the
largest; it has a wide free edge on each side, projects forwards
over the neck, and when the head is retracted, covers this also,
its semi-circular fore-edge then forming the apparent head-end
of the animal. The two succeeding terga are of nearly equal
size, and each is much shorter than the pronotum, contrary to
the rule in winged Insects<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span></p>
<p>All the terga are dense and opaque in the female; in the
male the middle one (<i>mesonotum</i>) and the hindmost (<i>metanotum</i>)
are thin and semi-transparent, being ordinarily overlaid
by the wing-covers. While the thoracic terga diminish backwards,
the sterna increase in extent and firmness, proportionally
to the size of the attached legs. The prosternum is small and
coffin-shaped; the mesosternum partly divided into lateral
halves in the male, and completely so in the female. The
metasternum is completely divided in both sexes, while a
median piece, carrying the post-furca, intervenes between its
lateral halves in the male. Behind the sterna, especially in the
case of the second and third, the flexible under-surface of the
thorax is inclined, so as to form a nearly vertical step. In the
two hinder of these steps a chitinous prop is fixed; each is
Y-shaped, with long, curved arms for muscular attachment, and
a central notch, which supports the nerve-cord. The hindmost
of these, known as the <i>post-furca</i>, lies immediately behind<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
the metasternum, and its short basal piece is attached between
the lateral halves of that plate. Behind the mesosternum is a
somewhat slighter prop, the <i>medi-furca</i>. A third piece of similar
nature (the <i>ante-furca</i>), which is well developed in some Insects&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
in Ants&mdash;is apparently wanting in the Cockroach, though
there is a transverse oval plate behind the prosternum, which
may be a rudimentary furca.</p>

<p>Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_27">27</a> shows two conical processes which lie in the middle
line of the ventral surface of the thorax, one in front of the
metasternum, the other in front of the mesosternum. These
are the thoracic pits, tubular apodemata, serving for the
insertion of muscles. The occurrence of stink-glands in
the thorax of Hemiptera<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> and of so-called poison-glands
in the thorax of <i>Solpuga</i>, led us to look for glands in
connection with these processes, but we have found none.</p>


<h3><i>Thoracic Appendages. Legs; Wings.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 460px;">
<a id="Fig_28"></a><img src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="460" height="703" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 28.&mdash;The three Thoracic Legs of a Fe­male Cock­roach. I, <i>s</i>, ster­num; <i>cx</i>, coxa;

ab­duct­ed, and the joints <i>a</i> (epi­ster­num) and <i>b</i> slight­ly se­par­ated. ×&nbsp;4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Three pairs of legs are attached to the thoracic segments;
they regularly increase in size from the first to the third, but
hardly differ except in size; the peculiar modifications which
affect the fore pair in predatory and burrowing Orthoptera
(<i>Mantis</i>, <i>Gryllotalpa</i>), and the third pair in leaping Orthoptera
(Grasshoppers, &amp;c.), being absent in the cursorial Blattina. Each
leg is divided into the five segments usual in Insects (see fig.&nbsp;28).
The coxa is broad and flattened. The trochanter is a small piece
obliquely and almost immovably attached to the proximal end
of the femur, on its inner side. The femur is nearly straight
and narrowed at both ends; along its inner border, in the
position occupied by the stridulating apparatus of the hind leg
of the Grasshoppers, is a shallow longitudinal groove, fringed
by stiff bristles. The tibia is shorter than the femur in the fore
leg, of nearly the same length in the middle leg, and longer in
the hind leg; it is armed with numerous stiff spines directed
towards the free end of the limb. There are usually reckoned
five joints in the tarsus, which regularly diminish in length,
except that the last joint is as long as the second. All the<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
joints bear numerous fine but stiff hairs upon the walking
surface. The extremity of the fifth joint is segmented off, and
carries a pair of equal and strongly curved claws<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>

<p>At the base of each leg are several chitinous plates (fig.&nbsp;28),
upon which no small labour has been bestowed by different
anatomists. They are arranged so as to form two joints intermediate
between the coxa and the sternum, and these two joints
admit of a hinge-like movement upon each other, while their
other ends are firmly attached to the coxa and sternum respectively.
(Compare III and III<span class="smcap">A</span>, fig.&nbsp;28.) These parts in the
Cockroach may be taken for two basal leg-joints which have
become adherent to the thorax. In other cases, however, they
plainly belong to the thorax, and not to the leg. In the Mole-cricket,
for instance, similar plates occur; but here they are
firmly united, and form the lateral wall of the thorax. In the
Locust they become vertical, and lie one in front of the other.
Most authors have looked upon them as regular elements of a
typical somite. They regard such a segment as including two
pleural elements—viz., a dorsal plate (<i>epimeron</i>), and a ventral
plate (<i>episternum</i>). We have already (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_34">34</a>) given reasons for
doubting the constancy of the pieces so named. It is not
inconvenient, however, to denote by the term <i>episternum</i> the
joint which abuts upon the sternum; for the joint which is
applied to the coxa no convenient term exists, and its occurrence
in Insects is so partial, that the want need not be supplied at
present<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> Both joints are incompletely subdivided. In the first
thoracic segment of the Cockroach they are less firmly connected
than in the other two.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 440px;">
<a id="Fig_29"></a><img src="images/i_p062.jpg" width="440" height="347" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 29.&mdash;Wings and Wing-covers of Male Cock­roach. ×&nbsp;4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Cockroaches of both sexes are provided with wings, which,
however, are only functional in the male. The wing-covers (or
anterior pair of wings) of the male are carried by the second
thoracic segment. As in most <i>Orthoptera genuina</i>, they are
denser than the hind wings, and protect them when at rest.
They reach to the fifth segment of the abdomen, and one<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
wing-cover overlaps the other. Branching veins or nervures
form a characteristic pattern upon the surface (figs. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a>, 29), and
it is mainly by means of this pattern that many of the fossil
species are identified and distinguished. The true or posterior
wings are attached to the metathorax. They are membranous
and flexible, but the fore-edge is stiffened, like that of the wing-covers,
by additional chitinous deposit. When extended, each
wing forms an irregular quadrant of a circle; when at rest, the
radiating furrows of the hinder part close up fan-wise, and the
inner half is folded beneath the outer<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> The wing reaches back
as far as the hinder end of the fourth abdominal segment. The
wing-covers of the female are small, and though movable, seem
never to be voluntarily extended; each covers about one-third
of the width of the mesonotum, and extends backwards to the
middle of the metanotum. A reticulated pattern on the outer
fourth of the metanotum plainly represents the hind wing; it
is clearly rather a degeneration or survival than an anticipation
of an organ tending towards useful completeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span></p>

<p>The rudimentary wing of the female Cockroach illustrates
the homology of the wings of Insects with the free edges of
thoracic terga, and this correspondence is enforced by the study
of the development of the more complete wings and wing-covers
of the male. The hinder edges of the terga become produced
at the later moults preceding the completely winged stage, and
may even assume something of the shape and pattern of true
wings; it is not, however, true, though more than once stated,
that winged nymphs are common. Adults with imperfectly
developed wings have been mistaken for such.</p>


<h3><i>Origin of Insect Wings.</i></h3>

<p>The structure of the wing testifies to its origin as a fold of
the chitinous integument. It is a double lamina, which often
encloses a visible space at its base. The nervures, with their
vessels and tracheal tubes, lie between the two layers, which,
except at the base, are in close contact. Oken termed the wings
of an Insect “aerial gills,” and this rather fanciful designation
is in some degree justified by their resemblance to the tracheal
gills of such aquatic larvæ as those of Ephemeridæ, Perlidæ,
Phryganidæ, &amp;c. In the larva of <i>Chloeon (Ephemera) dipterum</i>
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_30">30</a>), for example, the second thoracic segment carries a pair
of large expansions, which ultimately are replaced by organs
of aerial flight. The abdominal segments carry similarly
placed respiratory leaflets, the tracheal gills, which by their
vigorous flapping movements bring a rush of water against
their membranous and tracheated surfaces.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Gegenbaur<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> has argued from the resemblance of these
appendages to wings, that the wing and the tracheal leaflet are
homologous parts, and this view has been accepted as probable
by so competent an observer as Sir John Lubbock<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>The leaflets placed most advantageously for propulsion seem
to have become exclusively adapted to that end, while the
abdominal gills have retained their respiratory character. At
the time of change from aquatic to terrestrial life, which takes
place in many common Insects when the adult condition is<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
assumed, and which, according to Gegenbaur, was a normal
event among primitive Insects, the tracheal gill is supposed to
disappear, and in its place, at the next moult, an opening, the
stigma, is formed by the rupture of an air-tube. Gegenbaur
supposes that the primitive Insects were aquatic, and their
tracheal system closed. The tracheal gill he takes to be the
common structure which has yielded organs so unlike as the
wing and the stigma.</p>

<p>The zoological rank of the Insects (Ephemeridæ, Perlidæ,
and Libellulidæ), in which tracheal gills are most usual, is not
unfavourable to such an explanation. Lubbock has given
reasons for regarding <i>Campodea</i> and the Collembola (of the
order Thysanura) as surviving and not very much altered
representatives of the most primitive Insects, and he has shown
that no great amount of modification would be required to
convert the terrestrial <i>Campodea</i> into the aquatic <i>Chloeon</i>-nymph<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>
We must not forget, however, that tracheal gills
are by no means restricted to these families of low grade.
Trichoptera, a few Diptera, two Lepidoptera (<i>Nymphula</i> and
<i>Acentropus</i>), and two Coleoptera (<i>Gyrinus</i> and <i>Elmis</i>)<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> have
tracheal gills, and a closed tracheal system in the larval condition.
We cannot suppose that these larvæ of higher orders
represent an unbroken succession of aquatic forms, but if we
refuse to adopt this alternative, we must admit that the closed
tracheal system with tracheal gills may be an adaptive modification
of the open system with stigmata.</p>

<p>It is well <span class="nowrap">known<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> that in certain Ephemeridæ (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Tricorythus</i>
and <i>Cœnis</i>) a pair of anterior tracheal gills may become transformed
into large plates, which partly protect the gills behind
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_31">31</a>). A similar modification of the second and third
thoracic gills in <i>Prosopistoma</i> and <i>Bætisca</i> brings all the
functional respiratory organs under cover, and these enlarged
plates resemble stiff and simple wings very closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum hide" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Palmén<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> has subjected Gegenbaur’s hypothesis to a very
searching examination. He observes <span class="nowrap">that:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. In <i>Campodea</i>, and presumably in other primitive Insects,
the tracheal system is not closed and adapted for aquatic
respiration, but open. Tracheal gills are not by any means
confined to the lowest Insects. (See above, p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_65">65</a>.)</p>

<p>2. Tracheal gills are not always homodynamous or morphologically
equivalent. In Ephemeridæ, some are dorsal in
position, some ventral (first abdominal pair in <i>Oligoneuria</i> and
<i>Rhithrogena</i>); they may be cephalic, springing from the base of
the maxilla, as in <i>Oligoneuria</i> and <i>Jolia</i>; <i>Jolia</i> has a branchial
tuft at the insertion of each of the fore legs<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> In Perlidæ the
tracheal gills may have a tergal, pleural, sternal, or anal
insertion. In some Libellulidæ also, anal leaflets occur<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span></p>

<p>3. Tracheal gills never perfectly agree in position and
number with the stigmata throughout the body. Sometimes
they occur on different rings, sometimes on different parts of
the same ring. Gegenbaur’s statements on this point are
incorrect.</p>

<p>4. Tracheal gills may co-exist with stigmata. In Perlidæ
the tracheal gills persist in the imago, and may be found, dry
and functionless, beneath the stigmata. In Trichoptera they
gradually abort at successive moults, and in some cases remain
after the stigmata have opened.</p>

<p>5. Stigmata do not form by the breaking off of tracheal
appendages, but by the enlargement of rudimentary tracheal<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
branches, which open into the main longitudinal trunks. In
larvæ with aquatic respiration these branches exist, though they
are not functional.</p>

<p>Palmén’s objections must be satisfactorily disposed of before
Gegenbaur’s explanation, interesting as it is, can be fully
accepted. Palmén has proved, what is on other grounds clear
enough, that stigmata are more ancient than tracheal gills,
aerial tracheate respiration than aquatic. But there is nothing
as yet to contradict the view that the first Insect-wings were
adapted for propulsion in water, and that they were respiratory
organs before they became motor. It is Gegenbaur’s explanation
of the origin of stigmata, and not his explanation of the
origin of wings, which is refuted by Palmén.</p>


<h3><i>Abdomen.</i></h3>

<p>In the abdomen of the female Cockroach eight terga (1–7;
10) are externally visible. Two more (8, 9) are readily displayed
by extending the abdomen; they are ordinarily
concealed beneath the seventh tergum. The tenth tergum is
notched in the middle of its posterior margin. A pair of
triangular “podical plates,” which lie on either side of the
anus, and towards the dorsal surface, have been provisionally
regarded by Prof. Huxley as the terga of an eleventh segment.
Seven abdominal sterna (1–7) are externally visible. The first
is quite rudimentary, and consists of a transversely oval plate;
the second is irregular and imperfectly chitinised in front; the
seventh is large, and its hinder part, which is boat-shaped, is
divided into lateral halves, for facilitating the discharge of the
large egg-capsule.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<a id="Fig_32"></a><img src="images/i_p069.jpg" width="420" height="347" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 32.&mdash;Under side of Abdomen of Male and Fe­male Cock­roach. ×&nbsp;4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the male Cockroach ten abdominal terga are visible
without dissection (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_33">33</a>, p.&nbsp;70), though the eighth and
ninth are greatly overlapped by the seventh. The tenth
tergum is hardly notched. Nine abdominal sterna are readily
made out, the first being rudimentary, as in the female. The
eighth is narrower than the seventh, the ninth still narrower,
and largely concealed by the eighth; its covered anterior part
is thin and transparent, the exposed part denser. This forms
the extreme end of the body, except that the small sub-anal styles
project beyond it. The podical plates resemble those of the
female.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span></p>

<p>Pleural elements are developed in the form of narrow
stigmatic plates, with the free edge directed backwards. These
lie between the terga and sterna, and defend the spiracle<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span></p>

<p>The modifications of the hindmost abdominal segments will
be more fully considered in connection with the reproductive
organs.</p>

<p>The high number of abdominal segments found in the Cockroach
(ten or eleven) is characteristic of the lower orders of
Insecta. It is never exceeded; though in the more specialised
orders, such as Lepidoptera and Diptera, it may be reduced to
nine, eight, or even seven. The sessile abdomen of the Cockroach
is primitive with respect to the pedunculate abdomen
found in such insects as Hymenoptera, where the constricted
and flexible waist stands in obvious relation to the operations
of stinging and boring, or to peculiar modes of oviposition.
The first abdominal segment, which is especially liable to dislocation
and alteration in Insects, occupies its theoretical
position in the Cockroach, though both tergum and sternum<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
are reduced in size. The sternum is often altogether wanting,
while the tergum may unite with the metathorax.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_33"></a><img src="images/i_p070.jpg" width="500" height="299" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 33.&mdash;Profile of Male and Female Cockroach. ×&nbsp;4.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The externally visible appendages of the abdomen are the
cerci and the styles of the male Cockroach. The cerci are found
in both sexes; they are composed of sixteen rings each, and
project beneath the edge of the tenth tergum. They are
capable of erection by special muscles, and are supplied by large
nerves<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> The sub-anal styles are peculiar in their insertion,
being carried upon the sternum of their segment (the ninth).</p>

<p>The abdominal segments are never furnished with functional
legs in adult Insects, but representatives of the lost appendages
are often met with in larvæ. According to Bütschli<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> all the
abdominal segments are provided with appendages in the
embryo of the Bee, though they disappear completely before
hatching. Some Hymenopterous larvæ have as many as eight
pairs of abdominal appendages, Lepidopterous larvæ at most
five (3–6; 10)<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Structure of Insect Muscles.</i></h3>

<p>The muscles of the Cockroach, when quite fresh, appear
semi-transparent and colourless. If subjected to pressure or
strain they are found to be extremely tender. Alcohol hardens
and contracts them, while it renders them opaque and brittle.</p>

<p>The minute structure of the voluntary or striped muscular
fibres of Vertebrates is described in common text-books<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> Each
fibre is invested by a transparent elastic sheath, the sarcolemma,
and the space within the sarcolemma is subdivided by transverse
membranes into a series of compartments. The compartments
are nearly filled by as many contractile discs,
broad, doubly refractive plates, which are further divisible
into prismatic columns, the sarcous elements, each being as
long as the contractile disc. Successive sarcous elements,
continued from one compartment to another, form the
primitive fibrils of the muscle. In cross-section the fibrils
appear as polygonal areas bounded by bright lines. Outside
the fibres, but within the sarcolemma, are nuclei, imbedded in
the protoplasm, or living and formative element of the tissue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span></p>
<p>The muscular fibres of Insects present some important
differences from the fibres just described. The nuclei are often
found in the centre, and not on the surface of the fibres in both
Insects and Crustacea. In both classes the fibrils are frequently
subdivided into longitudinal strands, which have not been
distinguished in Vertebrate muscles (Viallanes). The sarcolemma
is often undeveloped. Lastly, Insects, like other
Arthropoda, exhibit the remarkable peculiarity that not only
their voluntary muscles, but all, or nearly all, the muscles of
the body, even those of the digestive tube, are striated<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span></p>


<h3><i>General Arrangement of Insect Muscles.</i></h3>

<p>The arrangement of the muscles in an Insect varies greatly
according to situation and mode of action. Some of the
abdominal muscles consist solely of straight parallel bundles,
while the muscles of the limbs usually converge to tendinous
insertions. In certain larvæ, where the segments show hardly
any differentiation, the muscles form a sheet which covers the
whole body, and is regularly segmented in correspondence with
the exo-skeleton. As the movements of the body and limbs
become more varied and more energetic, the muscles become
grouped in a more complicated fashion, and the legs and wings
of a flying Insect may be set in motion by a muscular apparatus
almost as elaborate as that of a bird.</p>


<h3><i>Muscles of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>The following short notes on the muscles of the Cockroach,
aided by reference to the figures, will render the more noteworthy
features intelligible. A very lengthy description, far
beyond our space or the reader’s patience, would be required to
explain in detail the musculature of the head, limbs, and other
specialised regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternal Muscles of Abdomen.</span>&mdash;The <i>longitudinal sternal
muscles</i> (fig.&nbsp;34) form a nearly continuous transversely seg<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>mented
sheet, covering the ventral surface between the fore-edge
of the second abdominal sternum and the fore-edge of the
seventh. These muscles, in conjunction with the longitudinal
tergal muscles, tend to telescope the segments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum hide" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span></p>

<p>The <i>oblique sternal muscles</i> (fig.&nbsp;34), which are very short,
connect the adjacent edges of the sterna (2–3, 3–4, 4–5, 5–6,
6–7). They extend inwards nearly to the middle line, but, like
the longitudinal sternal muscles, they are not developed beneath
the nerve-cord. Acting together, the oblique sternal muscles
would antagonise the longitudinal, but it is probable that they
are chiefly used to effect lateral flexion of the abdomen, and
that only the muscles of one side of the abdomen contract at
once.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>tergo-sternal</i> (or expiratory) muscles (figs. 35 and 36)
form vertical pairs passing from the outer part of each abdominal
sternum to the corresponding tergum. Their action is to
approximate the dorsal and ventral walls, and thus to reduce
the capacity of the abdomen. The first tergo-sternal muscle
has its ventral insertion into the stem of the postfurca, and
takes an oblique course to the first abdominal tergum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tergal Muscles of Abdomen.</span>&mdash;The <i>longitudinal tergal</i>
muscles extend from the fore part of each abdominal tergum,
including the first, to the same part of the tergum next behind.
They are interrupted by longitudinal spaces, so that the
muscular sheet is less continuous than on the ventral surface,
and has a fenestrated appearance. The direction of the fibres
is slightly oblique.</p>

<p><i>Oblique tergal</i> muscles, resembling the oblique muscles of the
sterna, are also present.</p>

<p>In the thorax the general arrangement of the muscles is
greatly modified by the altered form of the dorsal and ventral
plates, and by the attachment of powerful limbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternal Muscles of Thorax.</span>&mdash;Two tubular apodemes,
lying one behind the other, project into the thorax from the
ventral surface (p.&nbsp;59 and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_27">27</a>). To the foremost of these
are attached three paired muscles and one median muscle.
The median muscle passes to the second tubular apodeme. The
anterior pair pass forwards and outwards to the base of the
prothoracic leg; the next pair directly outwards to the base of
the middle leg; while the posterior pair pass outwards and
backwards to the arms of the medifurca. From the second
tubular apodeme, in front of the metasternum, four pairs of
muscles spring. Those of the anterior pass forwards and out<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>wards
to the coxa of the fore limb; the second pair directly
outwards to the base of the metathoracic legs; the third pair
backwards and outwards to the arms of the postfurca; the
fourth pair backwards to the second abdominal sternum.</p>

<p>The muscles attached to the medi- and postfurca (other than
those connecting them with the tubular apodemes) are:&mdash;<span class="pagenum hide" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
(1) A pair passing from the posterior edge of the arms
of the medifurca to the stem of the postfurca; (2) a pair
which diverge from the stem of the postfurca and proceed to
the fore part of the second abdominal sternum; (3) a pair
passing from the posterior edge of the arms of the postfurca,
these are directed inwards and backwards, and are inserted into
the hinder part of the second abdominal sternum; (4) a pair
already mentioned, which correspond in position and action to
the tergo-sternal muscles, and spring from the stem of the postfurca,
passing upwards and outwards to the sides of the first
abdominal tergum.</p>

another muscle, which moves the tar­sus forwards. Both muscles parallel­ise the
tar­sus to the axis of the body, but in oppo­site di­rec­tions.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The muscles attached to the arms of each furca pass to other
structures in or near the middle line of the body. The pull of
such muscles must alter the slope of the two steps in the
ventral floor of the thorax (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_58">58</a>, and fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_3">3</a>, p.&nbsp;12). When the
furca is drawn forwards, the step is rendered vertical or even
inclined forward, the sterna being approximated; while, on the
other hand, a backward pull brings the step into a horizontal
position, and separates the sterna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tergal Muscles of Thorax.</span>&mdash;The <i>longitudinal tergal</i> muscles
are much reduced in width when compared with those of the
abdomen. Sets of obliquely placed muscles, which may be
called the <i>lateral thoracic</i> muscles, arise from near the middle of
each tergum, and converge to tendinous insertions on the fore
edge of each succeeding tergum, close to the lateral wall of the
body.</p>

<p>The principal muscles of the legs are figured and named, and
their action can readily be inferred from the names assigned to
them.</p>


<h3><i>Insect Mechanics.</i></h3>

<p>The mechanics of Insect movements require exposition and
illustration far beyond what is possible in a book like this.
Even the elaborate dissections of Lyonnet and Straus-Dürckheim
are not a sufficient basis for a thorough treatment of the subject,
and until we possess many careful dissections, made by
anatomists who are bent upon mastering the action of the parts,
our views must needs be vague and of doubtful value. Zoologists<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
of great eminence have been led into erroneous statements when
they have attempted to characterise shortly a complex animal
mechanism which they did not think it worth while to analyse
completely<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span></p>

<p>The action of flight and the muscles attached to the wings
are best studied in Insects of powerful flight. The female
Cockroach cannot fly at all, and the male is by no means a good
flier. Both sexes are, however, admirably fitted for running.</p>

<p>In running, two sets, each consisting of three legs, move
simultaneously. A set includes a fore and hind limb of the
same side and the opposite middle leg. Numbering them from
before backwards, and distinguishing the right and left sides by
their initial letters, we can represent the legs which work
together <span class="nowrap">as&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="tac">
<a id="Fig_38"></a><img src="images/137x6bu.png" width="137" height="6" alt="" /><br />
R<sub>1</sub>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;L<sub>2</sub>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;R<sub>3</sub><br />

L<sub>1</sub>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;R<sub>2</sub>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;L<sub>3</sub>
</p>

<p>The different legs have different modes of action. The fore-leg
may be compared to a grappling-iron; it is extended,
seizes the ground with its claws, and drags the body towards
its point of attachment. The middle leg is chiefly used to
support and steady the body, but has some pushing power.
The hind leg, the largest of the three, is effective in shoving,
and chiefly propels the body.</p>


<h3><i>Muscular Force of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The force exerted by Insects has long been remarked with
surprise, and it is a fact familiar, not only to naturalists, but to
all observant persons, that, making allowance for their small
size, Insects are the most powerful of common animals.
<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
Popular books of natural history give striking and sometimes
exaggerated accounts of the prodigious strength put forth by
captive Insects in their efforts to escape. Thus we are told that
the flea can draw 70 or 80 times its own weight<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> The
Cockchafer is said to be six times as strong as a horse, making
allowance for size. A caterpillar of the Goat Moth, imprisoned
beneath a bell-glass, weighing half a pound, which was loaded
with a book weighing four pounds, nevertheless raised the glass
and made its escape.</p>

<p>This interesting subject has been investigated by Plateau<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span>
who devised the following experiment. The Insect to be
tested was confined within a narrow horizontal channel, which
was laid with cloth. A thread attached to its body was passed
over a light pulley, and fastened to a small pan, into which sand
was poured until the Insect could no longer raise it. Some of
the results are given in the following <span class="nowrap">table:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="tac"><i>Table of Relative Muscular Force of Insects (Plateau).</i></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal"></td><td class="tac fs80 prl1">Weight of body<br />in grammes.</td><td class="tac fs80 prl1">Ratio of weight lifted<br />to weight of body.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tal">Carabus auratus</td><td class="tac">0·703</td><td class="tac">17·4</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tal">Apis mellifica</td><td class="tac">0·090</td><td class="tac">23·5</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>One obvious result is that within the class of Insects the
relative muscular force (as commonly understood) is approximately
in the inverse proportion of the weight&mdash;that is, the
strength of the Insect is (by this mode of calculation) most
conspicuous in the smaller species.</p>

<p>In a later <span class="nowrap">memoir<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> Plateau gives examples from different
Vertebrate and Invertebrate animals, which lead to the same
general conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span></p>

<p class="tac"><i>Ratio of weight drawn to weight of body (Plateau).</i></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tal pr5">Horse</td><td class="tar"></td><td class="tal"><span class="ilb">·5&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;·83</span></td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The inference commonly drawn from such data is that the
muscles of small animals possess a force which greatly exceeds
that of large quadrupeds or man, allowance being made for size,
and that the explanation of this superior force is to be looked for
in some peculiarity of composition or texture. Gerstaecker<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> for
example, suggests that the higher muscular force of Arthropoda
may be due to the tender and yielding nature of their muscles.
An explanation so desperate as this may well lead us to inquire
whether we have understood the facts aright. Plateau’s figures
give us the ratio of the weight drawn or raised to the weight
of the animal. This we may, with him, take as a measure of
the <i>relative muscular force</i>. In reality, it is a datum of very
little physiological value. By general reasoning of a quite
simple kind it can be shown that, for muscles possessing the
same physical properties, the <i>relative</i> muscular force necessarily
increases very rapidly as the size of the animal decreases. For
the contractile force of muscles of the same kind depends simply
upon the number and thickness of the fibres, <i>i.e.</i>, upon the
sectional area of the muscles. If the size of the animal and of
its muscles be increased according to any uniform scale, the
sectional area of a given muscle will increase as the square of
any linear dimension. But the weight increases in a higher
proportion, according to the increase in length, breadth, and
depth jointly, or as the cube of any linear dimension<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> The<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
ratio of contractile force to weight must therefore become
rapidly smaller as the size of the animal increases. Plateau’s
second table (<i>see above</i>) actually gives a value for the relative
muscular force of the Bee, in comparison with the Horse, which
is only one-fourteenth of what it ought to turn out, supposing
that both animals were of similar construction, and that the
muscular fibres in both were equal in contractile force per unit
of sectional area<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span></p>

<p>A later series of <span class="nowrap">experiments<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> brings out this difference in a
precise form. Plateau has determined by ingenious methods
what he calls the <i>Absolute Muscular Force&#8239;</i><a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> of a number of
Invertebrate animals (Lamellibranch Mollusca, and Crustacea),
comparing them with man and other Vertebrates. His general
conclusions may be shortly given as follows:&mdash;The absolute
muscular force of the muscles closing the pincers of Crabs is<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
low in comparison with that of Vertebrate muscles. The absolute
force of the adductor muscles closing a bivalve shell may,
in certain Lamellibranchs, equal that of the most powerful
Mammalian muscles; in others it falls below that of the least
powerful muscles of the frog, which are greatly inferior in
contractile force to Mammalian muscles. We find, therefore,
that the low contractile force of Insect muscles is in harmony,
and not in contrast, with common observation of their physical
properties, and that the high <i>relative</i> muscular force, correctly
enough attributed to them, is explicable by considerations which
apply equally well to models or other artificial structures.</p>

<p>The comparison between the muscular force of Insects and
large animals is sometimes made in another way. For example,
in Carpenter’s <span class="nowrap">Zoology<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> the spring of the Cheese-hopper is
described, and we are told that “the height of the leap is often
from twenty to thirty times the length of the body; exhibiting
an energy of motion which is particularly remarkable in the
soft larva of an Insect. A Viper, if endowed with similar
powers, would throw itself nearly a hundred feet from the
ground.” It is here implied that the equation</p>

<p class="tac">
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Height of Insect’s leap</span><span class="fden">Length of Insect</span></span></span>&ensp;=&ensp;
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Supposed ht. of Viper’s leap (100&nbsp;ft.)</span><span class="fden">Length of Viper</span></span></span>
</p>

<p>should hold if the two animals were “endowed with similar
powers.”</p>

<p>But it is known that the work done by contraction of muscles
of the same kind is proportional to the volume of the muscles
(“Borelli’s Law”)<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> and in similar animals the muscular
volumes are as the weights. Therefore the equation</p>

<p class="tac">
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Work of Insect</span><span class="fden">Weight of Insect</span></span></span>&ensp;=&ensp;
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Work of Viper</span><span class="fden">Weight of Viper</span></span></span>
</p>

<p>will more truly represent the imaginary case of equal leaping
power. But the work = weight raised × height, and the weight
raised is in both cases the weight of the animal itself. Therefore</p>

<p class="tac">
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Wt.&ensp;×&ensp;Ht.</span><span class="fden">Wt.</span></span></span> (Insect)&ensp;=&ensp;
<span class="nowrap"><span class="fraction2"><span class="fnum">Wt.&ensp;×&ensp;Ht.</span><span class="fden">Wt.</span></span></span> (Viper),
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>

<p>and Ht. (Insect) = Ht. (Viper). The Viper’s efficiency as a
leaping animal would, therefore, equal that of a Cheese-hopper
if it leaped the same vertical height. Therefore, if the two
animals were “endowed with similar powers,” the heights to
which they could leap would be equal, and not proportional to
their lengths, as is assumed in the passage quoted.</p>

<p>Straus-Dürckheim observes that a Flea can leap a foot high,
which is 200 times its own length, and this has been considered
a stupendous feat. It is really less remarkable than a schoolboy’s
leap of two feet, for it indicates precisely as great
efficiency of muscles and other leaping apparatus as would be
implied in a man’s leap to the same height, viz., one foot<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Fat-body.</i></h3>

<p>Adhering to the inner face of the abdominal wall is a cellular
mass, which forms an irregular sheet of dense white appearance.
This is the fat-body. Its component cells are polygonal, and
crowded together. When young they exhibit nuclei and
vacuolated protoplasm, but as they get older the nuclei disappear,
the cell-boundaries become indistinct, and a fluid, loaded
with minute refractive granules<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> takes the place of the living
protoplasm. Rhombohedral or hexagonal crystals, containing
uric acid, form in the cells and become plentiful in old tissue.
The salt (probably urate of soda) is formed by the waste of
the proteids of the body. What becomes of it in the end we
do not know for certain, but conjecture that it escapes by the
blood which bathes the perivisceral cavity, that it is taken up
again by the Malpighian tubules, and is finally discharged into
the intestine. The old gorged cells probably burst from time to
time, and the infrequency of small cells among them renders it
probable that rejuvenescence takes place, the burst cells passing
through a resting-stage, accompanied by renewal of their
nuclei, and then repeating the cycle of change.</p>

<p>The segmental tubes forming the Wolffian body of Vertebrates
have at first no outlet, and embryologists have hesitated<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
to regard this phase of development as the permanent condition
of any ancestral form<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> It is, therefore, of interest to find in
the fat-body of the Cockroach an example of a solid, mesoblastic,
excretory organ, functional throughout life, but without
efferent duct.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i_p085.jpg" width="380" height="229" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 38.&mdash;Fat-body of Cockroach, cleared with tur­pen­tine. <i>A</i>, young tissue, with

<p>The fat-body is eminently a metabolic tissue, the seat of
active chemical change in the materials brought by the blood.
Its respiratory needs are attested by the abundant air-tubes
which spread through it in all directions.</p>

<p>The considerable bulk of the fat-body in the adult Cockroach
points to the unusual duration of the perfect Insect. It is
usually copious in full-fed larvæ, but becomes used up in the
pupa-stage.</p>

<p>Extensions of the fat-body surround the nervous chain, the
reproductive organs and other viscera. Sheets of the same
substance lie in the pericardial sinus on each side of the heart.</p>


<h3><i>The Cœlom.</i></h3>

<p>The fat-body is in reality, as development shows, the irregular
cellular wall of the cœlom, or perivisceral space. Through
this space courses the blood, flowing in no defined vessels, but
bathing all the walls and viscera. In other words, the fat-body
is an aggregation of little-altered mesoblast-cells, excavated by
the cœlom, the rest of the mesoblast having gone to form the
muscular layers of the body-wall and of the digestive tube.</p>

<h3><i>General Anatomy of Nervous Centres.</i></h3>

<p>The nervous system of the Cockroach comprises ganglia and
connectives<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> which extend throughout the body. We have
first, a supra-œsophageal ganglion, or brain, a sub-œsophageal
ganglion, and connectives which complete the œsophageal ring.
All these lie in the head; behind them, and extending through
the thorax and abdomen, is a gangliated cord, with double
connectives. The normal arrangement of the ganglia in
Annulosa, one to each somite, becomes more or less modified in
Insects by coalescence or suppression, and we find only eleven
ganglia in the Cockroach&mdash;viz., two cephalic, three thoracic,
and six abdominal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>

<p>The nervous centres of the head form a thick, irregular ring,
which swells above and below into ganglionic enlargements,
and leaves only a small central opening, occupied by the
œsophagus. The tentorium separates the brain or supra-œsophageal
ganglion from the sub-œsophageal, while the
connectives traverse its central plate. Since the œsophagus
passes above the plate, the investing nervous ring also lies
almost wholly above the tentorium.</p>

<p>The brain is small in comparison with the whole head; it
consists of two rounded lateral masses or hemispheres, incompletely
divided by a deep and narrow median fissure. Large
optic nerves are given off laterally from the upper part of each
hemisphere; lower down, and on the front of the brain, are the
two gently rounded antennary lobes, from each of which
proceeds an antennary nerve; while from the front and upper
part of each hemisphere a small nerve passes to the so-called
“ocellus,” a transparent spot lying internal to the antennary<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
socket on each side in the suture between the clypeus and the
epicranium. The sub-œsophageal ganglion gives off branches
to the mandibles, maxillæ, and labrum. While, therefore, the
supra-œsophageal is largely sensory, the sub-œsophageal ganglion
is the masticatory centre.</p>

<p>The œsophageal ring is double below, being completed by the
connectives and the sub-œsophageal ganglion; also by a smaller
transverse commissure, which unites the connectives, and applies
itself closely to the under-surface of the œsophagus<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span></p>

<p>Two long connectives issue from the top of the sub-œsophageal
ganglion, and pass between the tentorium and the
submentum on their way to the neck and thorax. The three
thoracic ganglia are large (in correspondence with the important
appendages of this part of the body) and united by double
connectives. The six abdominal ganglia have also double
connectives, which are bent in the male, as if to avoid
stretching during forcible elongation of the abdomen. The
sixth abdominal ganglion is larger than the rest, and is no
doubt a complex, representing several coalesced posterior
ganglia; it supplies large branches to the reproductive organs,
rectum, and cerci.</p>


<h3><i>Internal Structure of Ganglia.</i></h3>

<p>Microscopic examination of the internal structure of the
nerve-cord reveals a complex arrangement of cells and fibres.
The connectives consist almost entirely of nerve-fibres, which,
as in Invertebrates generally, are non-medullated. The ganglia
include (1) rounded, often multipolar, nerve-cells; (2) tortuous
and extremely delicate fibres collected into intricate skeins;
(3) commissural fibres, and (4) connectives. The chief fibrous
tracts are internal, the cellular masses outside them. A relatively
thick, and very distinct neurilemma, probably chitinous,
encloses the cord. Its cellular matrix, or chitinogenous layer,<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
is distinguished by the elongate nuclei of its constituent cells<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span>
Tracheal trunks pass to each ganglion, and break up upon and
within it into a multitude of fine branches.</p>

<p>Bundles of commissural fibres pass from the ganglion cells of
one side of the cord to the peripheral nerves of the other.
There are also longitudinal bands which blend to form the
connectives, and send bundles into the peripheral nerves. Of<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
the peripheral fibres, some are believed to pass direct to their
place of distribution, while others traverse at least one complete
segment and the corresponding ganglion before separating from
the cord.</p>

<p>Many familiar observations show that the ganglia of an
Insect possess great physiological independence. The limbs of
decapitated Insects, and even isolated segments, provided that
they contain uninjured ganglia, exhibit unmistakable signs of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Median Nerve-Cord.</i></h3>

<p>Lyonnet<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> Newport<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> and <span class="nowrap">Leydig<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> have found in large
Insects a system of median nerves, named <i>respiratory</i> (Newport)
or <i>sympathetic</i> (Leydig). These nerves do not form a continuous
cord extending throughout the body, but take fresh origin
in each segment from the right and left longitudinal commissures
alternately. The median nerve lies towards the dorsal
side of the principal nerve-cord, crosses over the ganglion next
behind, and receives a small branch from it. Close behind the
ganglion it bifurcates, the branches passing outwards and
blending with the peripheral nerves. Each branch, close to its
origin, swells into a ganglionic enlargement. The median
nerve and its branches differ in appearance and texture from
ordinary peripheral nerves, being more transparent, delicate,
and colourless. They are said to supply the occlusor muscles of
the stigmata. In the Cockroach the median nerves are so
slightly developed in the thorax and abdomen (if they
actually exist) that they are hardly discoverable by ordinary
dissection. We have found only obscure and doubtful traces
of them, and these only in one part of the abdominal nerve-cord.
The stomato-gastric nerves next to be described
appear to constitute a peculiar modification of that median
nerve-cord which springs from the circum-œsophageal
connectives.</p>


<h3><i>Stomato-gastric Nerves.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">
<a id="Fig_44"></a><img src="images/i_p093.jpg" width="260" height="481" alt="" />

</div>

<p>In the Cockroach the stomato-gastric nerves found in so
many of the higher Invertebrates are conspicuously developed.
From the front of each œsophageal connective, a nerve passes
forwards upon the œsophagus, outside the chitinous crura of the
tentorium. Each nerve sends a branch downwards to the
labrum, and the remaining fibres, collected into two bundles,
join above the œsophagus to form a triangular enlargement, the<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
frontal ganglion. From this ganglion a recurrent nerve passes
backwards through the œsophageal ring, and ends on the dorsal
surface of the crop (·3 inch from the ring), in a triangular
ganglion, from which a nerve is given off outwards and backwards
on either side. Each nerve bifurcates, and then breaks
up into branches which are distributed to the crop and gizzard<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span>
Just behind the œsophageal ring, the recurrent nerve forms a<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
plexus with a pair of nerves which proceed from the back of
the brain. Each nerve forms two ganglia, one behind the
other, and each ganglion sends a branch inwards to join the
recurrent nerve. Fine branches proceed from the paired nerves
of the œsophageal plexus to the salivary glands.</p>

<p>The stomato-gastric nerves differ a good deal in different
insects; <span class="nowrap">Brandt<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> considers that the paired and unpaired nerves
are complementary to each other, the one being more elaborate,
according as the other is less developed. A similar system is
found in Mollusca, Crustacea, and some Vermes (<i>e.g.</i>, Nemerteans).
When highly developed, it contains unpaired ganglia and
nerves, but may be represented only by an indefinite plexus
(earthworm). It always joins the œsophageal ring, and sends
branches to the œsophagus and fore-part of the alimentary canal.
The system has been identified with the sympathetic, and also
with the vagus of Vertebrates, but such correlations are hazardous;
the first, indeed, may be considered as disproved.</p>


<h3><i>Internal Structure of Brain.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p>The minute structure of the brain has been investigated by
Leydig, Dietl, Flögel, and others, and exhibits an unexpected
complexity. It is as yet impossible to reduce the many curious
details which have been described to a completely intelligible
account. The physiological significance, and the homologies
of many parts are as yet altogether obscure. The comparative
study of new types will, however, in time, bridge over the wide
interval between the Insect-brain and the more familiar Vertebrate-brain,
which is partially illuminated by physiological
experiment. Mr. E.&nbsp;T. Newton has published a clear and
useful <span class="nowrap">description<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> of the internal and external structure of the
brain of the Cockroach, which incorporates what had previously
been ascertained with the results of his own investigations. He
has also <span class="nowrap">described<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> an ingenious method of combining a
number of successive sections into a dissected model of the<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
brain. Having had the advantage of comparing the model with
the original sections, we offer a short abstract of Mr. Newton’s
memoir as the best introduction to the subject. He describes
the central framework of the Cockroach brain as consisting of
two solid and largely fibrous trabeculæ, which lie side by side
along the base of the brain, becoming smaller at their hinder
ends; they meet in the middle line, but apparently without
fusion or exchange of their fibres. Each trabecula is continued
upwards by two fibrous columns, the cauliculus in front, and the
peduncle behind; the latter carries a pair of cellular disks, the
calices (the cauliculus, though closely applied to the calices, is
not connected with them); these disks resemble two soft cakes
pressed together above, and bent one inwards, and the other
outwards below. The peduncle divides above, and each branch
joins one of the calices of the same hemisphere.</p>

consists of smaller cells without nucleoli. Above the meeting-place
of the trabeculæ is a peculiar laminated mass, the <i>central
body</i>, which consists of a network of fibres continuous with the
neighbouring ganglionic cells, and enclosing a granular substance.
The antennary lobes consist of a network of fine fibres
enclosing ganglion cells, and surrounded by a layer of the
same. It is remarkable that no fibrous communications can be
made out between the calices and the cauliculi, or between the
trabeculæ and the œsophageal connectives.</p>

<h3><i>Sense Organs. The Eye of Insects.</i></h3>

the princi­pal diam­eters. <i>as</i>, anten­nary socket.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sense organs of Insects are very variable, both in position
and structure. Three special senses are indicated by transparent
and refractive parts of the cuticle, by tense membranes
with modified nerve-endings, and by peculiar sensory rods or<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
filaments upon the antennæ. These are taken to be the organs
respectively of sight, hearing, and smell. Other sense organs,
not as yet fully elucidated, may co-exist with these. The
maxillary palps of the Cockroach, for example, are continually
used in exploring movements, and may assist the animal to
select its food; the cerci, where these are well-developed, and
the halteres of Diptera, have been also regarded as sense organs
of some undetermined kind, but this is at present wholly
conjecture<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span></p>

<p>The compound eyes of the Cockroach occupy a large, irregularly
oval space (see fig.&nbsp;50) on each side of the head. The
total number of facets may be estimated at about 1,800. The
number is very variable in Insects, and may either greatly
exceed that found in the Cockroach, or be reduced to a very
small one indeed. According to Burmeister, the Coleopterous
genus Mordella possesses more than 25,000 facets. Where the
facets are very numerous, the compound eyes may occupy
nearly the whole surface of the head, as in the House-fly
Dragon-fly, or Gad-fly.</p>

<p>Together with compound eyes, many Insects are furnished
also with simple eyes, usually three in number, and disposed in<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
a triangle on the forehead. The white fenestræ, which in the
Cockroach lie internal to the antennary sockets, may represent
two simple eyes which have lost their dioptric apparatus. In
many larvæ only simple eyes are found, and the compound eye
is restricted to the adult form; in larval Cockroaches, however,
the compound eye is large and functional.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Each facet of the compound eye is the outermost element of a
series of parts, some dioptric and some sensory, which forms
one of a mass of radiating rods or fibres. The facets are<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
transparent, biconvex, and polygonal, often, but not quite
regularly, hexagonal. In many Insects the deep layer of each
facet is separable, and forms a concavo-convex layer of different
texture from the superficial and biconvex lens. The facets,
taken together, are often described as the cornea; they represent
the chitinous cuticle of the integument. The subdivision
of the cornea into two layers of slightly different texture
suggests an achromatic correction, and it is quite possible,
though unproved, that the two sets of prisms have different
dispersive powers. Beneath the cornea we find a layer of
crystalline cones, each of which rests by its base upon the inner
surface of a facet, while its apex is directed inwards towards
the brain. The crystalline cones are transparent, refractive,
and coated with dark pigment; in the Cockroach they are
comparatively short and blunt. Behind each cone is a nerve-rod
(rhabdom), which, though outwardly single for the greater
part of its length, is found on cross-section to consist of four
components (rhabdomeres<span class="nowrap">)<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>; these diverge in front, and receive
the tip of a cone, which is wedged in between them; the
nerve-rods are densely pigmented. The rhabdom is invested by
a protoplasmic sheath, which is imperfectly separated into<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
segments (retinulæ), corresponding in number with the rhabdomeres.
Each retinula possesses at least one nucleus. The
retinulæ were found by Leydig to possess a true visual purple.
To the hinder ends of the retinulæ are attached the fibres of
the optic nerve, which at this point emerges through a “fenestrated
membrane.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the simple eye the non-faceted cornea and the retinula are
readily made out, but the crystalline cones are not developed
as such. The morphological key to both structures is found in
the integument, of which the whole eye, simple or compound, is
a modification. A defined tract of the chitinous cuticle becomes
transparent, and either swells into a lens (fig.&nbsp;53), or becomes
regularly divided into facets (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_55">55</a>), which are merely the
elaboration of imperfectly separated polygonal areas, easily
recognised in the young cuticle of all parts of the body. Next,
the chitinogenous layer is folded inwards, so as to form a cup,
and this, by the narrowing of the mouth, is transformed into a
flask, and ultimately into a solid two-layered cellular mass (fig.
53). The deep layer undergoes conversion into a retina, its
chitinogenous cells developing the nerve-rods as interstitial
structures, while the superficial layer, which loses its functional<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
importance in the simple eye, gives rise by a similar process of
interstitial growth to the crystalline cones of the compound eye
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_55">55</a>). The basement-membrane, underlying the chitinogenous
cells, is transformed into the fenestrated membrane.
The nerve-rods stand upon it, like organ pipes upon the sound-board,
while fibrils of the optic nerve and fine tracheæ pass
through its perforations. The mother-cells of the crystalline
cones and nerve-rods are largely replaced by the interstitial
substances they produce, to which they form a sheath; they are
often loaded with pigment, and the nuclei of the primitive-cells
can only be distinguished after the colouring-matter has been
discharged by acids or alkalis.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="nowrap">Hickson<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> has lately investigated the minute anatomy of
the optic tract in various Insects. He finds, in the adult of the
higher Insects, three distinct ganglionic swellings, consisting of
a network of fine fibrils, surrounded by a sheath of crowded
nerve-cells. Between the ganglia the fibres usually decussate.
In the Cockroach, and some other of the lower Insects, the<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
outermost ganglion is undeveloped. The fibres connecting the
second ganglion with the eye take a straight course in the
young Cockroach, but partially decussate in the adult.</p>

<p>All the parts between the crystalline cones and the true optic
nerve are considered by Hickson to compose the retina of
Insects, which, instead of ending at the fenestrated-membrane,
as has often been assumed, includes the ganglia and decussating
fibres of the optic tract. The layer of retinulæ and rhabdoms
does not form the whole retina, but merely that part which, in
the vertebrate eye, is known as the layer of rods and cones.</p>

<p>As to the way in which the compound eye renders distinct
vision possible, there is still much difference of opinion. A
short review of the discussion which has occupied some of the
most eminent physiologists and histologists for many years
past will introduce the reader to the principal facts which have
to be reconciled.</p>

<p>The investigation, like so many other trains of biological
inquiry, begins with Leeuwenhoeck (Ep. ad Soc. Reg. Angl. iii.),
who ascertained that the cornea of a shardborne Beetle, placed<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
in the field of a microscope, gives images of surrounding objects,
and that these images are inverted. When the cornea is
flattened out for microscopic examination, the images (<i>e.g.</i>, of a
window or candle-flame) are similar, and it has been too hastily
assumed that a multitude of identical images are perceived by
the Insect. The cornea of the living animal is, however,
convex, and the images formed by different facets cannot be
precisely identical. No combined or collective image is formed
by the cornea. When the structure of the compound eye had
been very inadequately studied, as was the case even in Cuvier’s
time (Leçons d’Anat. Comp., xii., 14), it was natural to suppose
that all the fibres internal to the cornea were sensory, that they
formed a kind of retina upon which the images produced by the
facets were received, and that these images were transmitted to
the brain, to be united, either by optical or mental combination,
into a single picture. Müller<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> in 1826, pointed out that so
simple an explanation was inadmissible. He granted that the
simple eye, with its lens and concave retina, produces a single
inverted image, which is able to affect the nerve-endings in the
same manner as in Vertebrates. But the compound eye is not
optically constructed so as to render possible the formation of
continuous images. The refractive and elongate crystalline
cones, with their pointed apices and densely pigmented sides,
must destroy any images formed by the lenses of the cornea.
Even if the dioptric arrangement permitted the formation of
images, there is no screen to receive them<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> Lastly, if this
difficulty were removed, Müller thought it impossible for the
nervous centres to combine a great number of inverted partial
images. How then can Insects and Crustaceans see with their
compound eyes? Müller answered that each facet transmits a
small pencil of rays travelling in the direction of its axis, but
intercepts all others. The refractive lens collects the rays, and
the pigmented as well as refractive crystalline cone further
concentrates the pencil, while it stops out all rays which diverge
appreciably from the axis. Each element of the compound eye
transmits a single impression of greater or less brightness, and<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
the brain combines these impressions into some kind of picture,
a picture like that which could be produced by stippling. It
may be added that the movements of the insect’s head or body
would render the distance and form of every object in view
much readier of appreciation. No accommodation for distance
would be necessary, and the absence of all means of accommodation
ceases to be perplexing. Such is Müller’s theory of what he
termed “mosaic vision.” Many important researches, some
contradictory, some confirmatory of Müller’s doctrine<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> have
since been placed on record, with the general result that some
modification of Müller’s theory tends to prevail. The most
important of the new facts and considerations which demand
attention are <span class="nowrap">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Reasons have been given for supposing that images are formed
by the cornea and crystalline cones together. This was first
pointed out by Gottsche (1852), who used the compound eyes of
Flies for demonstration. Grenacher has since ascertained that
the crystalline cones of Flies are so fluid that they can hardly
be removed, and he believes that Gottsche’s images were formed
by the corneal facets alone. He finds, however, that the
experiment may be successfully performed with eyes not liable
to this objection, <i>e.g.</i>, the eyes of nocturnal Lepidoptera. A bit
of a Moth’s eye is cut out, treated with nitric acid to remove the
pigment, and placed on a glass slip in the field of the microscope.
The crystalline cones, still attached to the cornea, are
turned towards the observer, and one is selected whose axis
coincides with that of the microscope. No image is visible
when the tip of the cone is in focus, but as the cornea
approaches the focus, a bristle, moved about between the mirror
and the stage, becomes visible. This experiment is far from
decisive. No image is formed where sensory elements are
present to receive and transmit it. Moreover, the image is
that of an object very near to the cornea, whereas all observations
of living Insects show that the compound eye is used for
far sight, and the simple eye for near sight. Lastly, the treatment
with acid, though unavoidable, may conceivably affect the<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
result. It is not certain that the cones really assist in the
production of the image, which may be due to the corneal
facets alone, though modified by the decolorised cones.</p>

<p>Grenacher has pointed out that the composition of the nerve-rod
furnishes a test of the mosaic theory. According as the
percipient rod is simple or complex, we may infer that its
physiological action will be simple or complex too. The
adequate perception of a continuous picture, though of small
extent, will require many retinal rods; on the other hand, a
single rod will suffice for the discrimination of a bright point.
What then are the facts of structure? Grenacher has ascertained
that the retinal rods in each element of the compound
eye rarely exceed seven, and often fall as low as four&mdash;further,
that the rods in each group are often more or less completely
fused so as to resemble simple structures, and that this is
especially the case with Insects of keen sight<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span></p>

<p>Certain facts described by Schultze tell on the other side.
Coming to the Arthropod eye, fresh from his investigation of
the vertebrate retina, Schultze found in the retinal rods of
Insects the same lamellar structure which he had discovered in
Vertebrata. He found also that in certain Moths, Beetles, and
Crustacea, a bundle of extremely fine fibrils formed the outer
extremity of each retinal or nerve-rod. This led him to reject
the mosaic theory of vision, and to conclude that a partial image
was formed behind every crystalline cone, and projected upon a
multitude of fine nerve-endings. Such a retinula of delicate
fibrils has received no physiological explanation, but it is
now known to be of comparatively rare occurrence; it has
no pigment to localise the stimulus of light; and there is
no reason to suppose that an image can be formed within its
limits.</p>

<p>The optical possibility of such an eye as that interpreted to
us by Müller has been conceded by physicists and physiologists
so eminent as Helmholz and Du Bois Reymond. Nevertheless,
the competence of any sort of mosaic vision to explain the
precise and accurate perception of Insects comes again and
again into question whenever we watch the movements of a<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
House-fly as it avoids the hand, of a Bee flying from flower to
flower, or of a Dragon-fly in pursuit of its prey. The sight of
such Insects as these must range over several feet at least, and
within this field they must be supposed to distinguish small
objects with rapidity and certainty. How can we suppose that
an eye without retinal screen, or accommodation for distance, is
compatible with sight so keen and discriminating? The answer
is neither ready nor complete, but our own eyesight shows how
much may be accomplished by means of instruments far from
optically perfect. According to Aubert, objects, to be perceived
as distinct by the human eye, must have an angular distance of
from 50″ to 70″, corresponding to several retinal rods. Our
vision is therefore mosaic too, and the retinal rods which can
be simultaneously affected comprise only a fraction of those
contained within the not very extensive area of the effective
retina. Still we are not conscious of any break in the continuity
of the field of vision. The incessant and involuntary
movements of the eyeball, and the appreciable duration of the
light-stimulus partly explain the continuity of the image
received upon a discontinuous organ. Even more important is
the action of the judgment and imagination, which complete
the blanks in the sensorial picture, and translate the shorthand
of the retina into a full-length description. That much of what
we see is seen by the mind only is attested by the inadequate
impression made upon us by a sudden glimpse of unfamiliar
objects. We need time and reflection to interpret the hints
flashed upon our eyes, and without time and reflection we see
nothing in its true relations. The Insect-eye may be far from
optical perfection, and yet, as it ranges over known objects, the
Insect-mind, trained to interpret colour, and varying brightness,
and parallax, may gain minute and accurate information.
Grant that the compound eye is imperfect, and even rude, if
regarded as a camera; this is not its true character. It is
intended to receive and interpret flashing signals; it is an
optical telegraph.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Plateau<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span> has recently submitted the seeing powers of a
number of different Insects to actual experiment. The two
windows of a room five metres square were darkened. An<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
aperture fitted with ground glass was then arranged in each
window. At a distance of four metres from the centre of the
space between the windows captive Insects were from time to
time liberated. One of the windows was fenced with fine trellis,
so as to prevent the passage of the Insect, or otherwise altered
in form, but the size of the aperture could be increased at
pleasure, so as exactly to make up for any loss of light caused
thereby, the brightness of the two openings being compared by
a photometer.</p>

<p>It was found that day-flying Insects require a tolerably good
light; in semi-obscurity they cannot find their way, and often
refuse to fly at all. By varnishing one or other set in Insects
possessing both simple and compound eyes, it was found that
day-flying Insects provided with compound eyes do not use their
simple eyes to direct their course. When the light from one
window was sensibly greater than that from the other, the
Insect commonly chose the brightest, but the existence of bars,
close enough to prevent or to check its passage, had no perceptible
effect upon the choice of its direction. Alterations in the
shape of one of the panes seemed to be immaterial, provided
that the quantity of light passing through remained the same,
or nearly the same. Plateau concludes that Insects do not
distinguish the forms of objects, or distinguish them very
imperfectly.</p>

<p>It is plain, and Plateau makes this remark himself, that such
experiments upon the power of unaided vision in Insects, give a
very inadequate notion of the facility with which an Insect
flying at large can find its way. There the animal is guided by
colour, smell, and the actual or apparent movements of all
visible objects. Exner has pointed out how important are the
indications given by movement. Even in man, the central
part of the retina is alone capable of precise perception of
form, but a moving object is observed by the peripheral tract.
Plateau (from whom this quotation is made) adds that most
animals are very slightly impressed by the mere form of
their enemies, or of their prey, but the slightest movement
attracts their notice. The sportsman, the fisherman, and the
entomologist cannot fail to learn this fact by repeated and
cogent proofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Sense of Smell in Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The existence of a sense of smell in Insects has probably
never been disputed. Many facts of common observation prove
that carrion-feeders, for example, are powerfully attracted
towards putrid animal substances placed out of sight. The
situation of the olfactory organs has only been ascertained by
varied experiments and repeated discussion. Rosenthal, in
1811, and Lefebvre, in 1838, indicated the antennæ as the
organs of smell, basing their conclusions upon physiological
observations made upon living insects. Many entomologists of
that time were inclined to regard the antennæ as auditory
organs<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> Observations on the minute structure of the antennæ
were made by many workers, but for want of good histological
methods and accurate information concerning the organs of
smell in other animals, these proved for a long time indecisive.
It was by observation of living insects that the point was
actually determined.</p>

<p>Hauser’s experiments, though by no means the first, are the
most instructive which we possess. He found that captive
insects, though not alarmed by a clean glass rod cautiously
brought near, became agitated if the same rod had been first
dipped in carbolic acid, turpentine, or acetic acid. The antennæ
performed active movements while the rod was still distant, and
after it was withdrawn the insect was observed to wipe its
antennæ by drawing them through its mouth. After the
antennæ had been extirpated or coated with paraffin, the same
insects became indifferent to strong-smelling substances, though
brought quite near. Extirpation of the antennæ prevented flies
from discovering putrid flesh, and hindered or prevented copulation
in insects known to breed in captivity.</p>

<p>Following up these experiments by histological investigation
of many insects belonging to different orders, Hauser clearly
established the following points, which had been partially made
known <span class="nowrap">before:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The sensory elements of the antennæ are lodged in grooves
or pits, which may be filled with fluid. The nerve-endings are
associated with peculiar rods, representing modified chitino<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>genous
cells. The number of grooves or pits may be enormous.
In the male of the Cockchafer, Hauser estimates that there are
39,000 in each antenna. He remarks that in all cases where
the female Insect is sluggish and prone to concealment, the

<h3><i>Sense of Taste in Insects.</i></h3>

<p>F. <span class="nowrap">Will<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span> gives an account of many authors who have investigated
with more or less success the sense organs of various
Insects. He relates also the results of his own experiments,
and gives anatomical details of the sensory organs of the mouth
in various Hymenoptera.</p>

<p>Wasps, flying at liberty, were allowed to visit and taste a
packet of powdered sugar. This was left undisturbed for some
hours, and then replaced by alum of the same appearance. The
Wasps attacked the alum, but soon indicated by droll movements
that they perceived the difference. They put their
tongues in and out and cleansed them from the ill-tasted powder.
Two persisted at the alum till they rolled on the table in agony,
but they soon recovered and flew away. In a few hours the
packet was quite deserted. After a day’s interval, during
which the sugar lay in its usual place, powdered, and of course
perfectly tasteless, dolomite was substituted. The wasps licked
it diligently and could not be persuaded for a long time that it
could do nothing for them. Similar experiments were made
with other substances, and Insects whose antennæ and palps
had been removed were subjected to trial. The result clearly
proved that a sense of taste existed, and that its seat is in the
mouth<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> Peculiar nerve-endings, such as Meinert and Forel
had previously found in Ants, were found in abundance on the
labium, the paraglossæ, and the inner side of the maxillæ of
the Wasp. Some lay in pits, through the bases of which single
nerves emerged, and swelled into bulbs, or passed into peculiar
conical sheaths. Interspersed among the gustatory nerve-endings
were setæ of various kinds, some protective, some tactile,
and others intended to act as guiding-hairs for the saliva.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span></p>
<p>Will observes that the organs described satisfy the essential
conditions of a sense of taste. The nerve-endings pass free to
the surface, and are thus directly accessible to chemical stimulus.
Further, they are so placed that they and the particles of food
which get access to them are readily bathed by the saliva.
Moistened or dissolved in this fluid, the sapid properties of food
are most fully developed.</p>

<p>The sensory pits and bulbs appropriated to taste are believed
to be unusually abundant in the social Hymenoptera.</p>


<h3><i>Sense of Hearing in Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The auditory organs of Insects and other Arthropoda are remarkable
for the various parts of the body in which they occur.
Thus they have been found in the first abdominal segment of
Locusts, and in the tibia of the fore-leg of Crickets and
Grasshoppers, and more questionable structures with peculiar
nerve-endings have been described as occurring in the hinder
part of the abdomen of various larvæ (<i>Ptychoptera</i>, <i>Tabanus</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>).
The auditory organ of Decapod Crustacea is lodged in the base
of the antennule, that of Stomapods in the tail, while an
auditory organ has been lately discovered on the underside of
the head of the Myriopod <i>Scutigera</i>.</p>

<p>Auditory organs are best developed in such Insects as
produce sounds as a call to each other. The Cockroach is
dumb, and it is, therefore, not a matter of surprise that no
structure which can be considered auditory should have ever
been detected in this Insect<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span></p>

<p>The sensory hairs of the skin have been already noticed
(p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_31">31</a>).</p>

<h3><i>The Alimentary Canal.</i></h3>

<p>The alimentary canal of the Cockroach measures about <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span>
inches in length, and is therefore about <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> times the length of
the body. In herbivorous Insects the relative length of the
alimentary canal may be much greater than this; it is five<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
times the length of the body in Hydrophilus. Parts of the
canal are specialised for different digestive offices, and their

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 56.&mdash;Alimentary Canal of Cock­roach. ×&nbsp;2.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The principal appendages of the alimentary canal are the
salivary glands, the cæcal diverticula of the stomach, and the
Malpighian tubules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>

<p>Considered with respect to its mode of formation, the alimentary
canal of all but the very simplest animals falls into three
sections&mdash;viz., (1) the mesenteron, or primitive digestive cavity,
lined by hypoblast; (2) the stomodæum, or mouth-section,
lined by epiblast, continuous with that of the external surface;
and (3) the proctodæum, or anal section, lined by epiblast
folded inwards from the anus, just as the epiblast of the
stomodæum is folded in from the mouth. The mesenteron of the
Cockroach is very short, as in other Arthropoda, and includes
only the chylific stomach with its diverticula. The mouth,
œsophagus, and crop form the stomodæum, while the proctodæum
begins with the Malpighian tubules, and extends
thence to the anus. Both stomodæum and proctodæum have
a chitinous lining, which is wanting in the mesenteron. At the
time of moult, or a little after, this lining is broken up and
passed out of the body.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Cockroach is enclosed between the labrum
in front, and the labium behind, while it is bounded laterally
by the mandibles and first pair of maxillæ. The chitinous
lining is thrown into many folds, some of which can be
obliterated by distension, while others are permanent and filled
with solid tissues. The lingua is such a permanent fold, lying
like a tongue upon the posterior wall of the cavity and reaching
as far as the external opening. The thin chitinous surface of
the lingua is hairy, like other parts of the mouth, and stiffened
by special chitinous rods or bands. The salivary ducts open by
a common orifice on its hinder surface. Above, the mouth leads
into a narrow gullet or œsophagus, with longitudinally folded
walls, which traverses the nervous ring, and then passes
through the occipital foramen to the neck and thorax. Here it<span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
gradually dilates into the long and capacious crop, whose large
rounded end occupies the fore-part of the abdomen. When
empty, or half-empty, the wall of the crop contracts, and is
thrown into longitudinal folds, which disappear on distension.
Numerous tracheal tubes ramify upon its outer surface, and
appear as fine white threads upon a greenish-grey ground.</p>

<p>Three layers can be distinguished in the wall of the crop&mdash;viz.,
(1) the muscular, (2) the epithelial, and (3) the chitinous
layer<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> The muscular layer consists of annular and longitudinal
fibres, crossing at right angles. (See fig.&nbsp;58.) In most
animals the muscles of organic life, subservient to nutrition and
reproduction, are very largely composed of plain or unstriped
fibres. In Arthropoda (with the exception of the anomalous
Peripatus) this is not generally the case, and the muscular fibres
of the alimentary canal belong to the striped variety. The
epithelium rests upon a thin structureless basement-membrane,
which is firmly united in the œsophagus and crop to the
muscular layer and the epithelium. The epithelium consists of
scattered nucleated cells, rounded or oval. These epithelial
cells, homologues of the chitinogenous cells of the integument,
secrete the transparent and structureless chitinous lining.
Hairs (setæ) of elongate, conical form, and often articulated at
the base, like the large setæ of the outer skin, are abundant.<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
In the œsophagus they are very long, and grouped in bundles
along sinuous transverse lines. In the crop the hairs become
shorter, and the sinuous lines run into a polygonal network.
The points of the hairs are directed backwards, and they no
doubt serve to guide the flow of saliva towards the crop.</p>

<p>The gizzard has externally the form of a blunt cone, attached
by its base to the hinder end of the crop, and produced at the
other end into a narrow tube (<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> to <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span>&nbsp;in. long), which projects
into the chylific stomach. Its muscular wall is thick, and
consists of many layers of annular fibres, while the internal
cavity is nearly closed by radiating folds of the chitinous lining.
Six of the principal folds, the so-called “teeth,” are much
stronger than the rest, and project so far inwards that they
nearly meet. They vary in form, but are generally triangular
in cross section and irregularly quadrilateral in side view.
Between each pair are three much less prominent folds, and
between these again are slight risings of the chitinous lining.
A ridge runs along each side of the base of each principal tooth,
and the minor folds, as well as part of the principal teeth, are
covered with fine hairs. The central one of each set of
secondary folds is produced behind into a spoon-shaped process,
which extends considerably beyond the rest, and gradually
subsides till it hardly projects from the internal surface of the
gizzard. Behind each large tooth (<i>i.e.</i>, towards the chylific<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
stomach) is a rounded cushion set closely with hairs, and
between and beyond these are hairy ridges. (See fig.&nbsp;61.) The
whole forms an elaborate machine for squeezing and straining
the food, and recalls the gastric mill and pyloric strainer of the
Crayfish. The powerful annular muscles approximate the teeth
and folds, closing the passage, while small longitudinal muscles,
which can be traced from the chitinous teeth to the cushions,
appear to retract these last, and open a passage for the food<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span></p>

<p>The gizzard ends below, as we have already mentioned, in a
narrow cylindrical tube which is protruded into the chylific
stomach for about one-third of an inch. Folds project from the
wall of this tube, and reduce its central cavity to an irregular
star-like figure. Below it ends in free processes slightly
different from each other in size and shape. The chitinous
lining and the chitinogenous layer beneath pass to the end of
the tube and are then reflected upon its outer wall, ascending
till they meet the lining epithelium of the cæcal tubes. Between
the wall of the gizzard-tube and its external reflected layer,
tracheal tubes, fat-cells, and longitudinal muscles are enclosed.</p>

<p>The chylific stomach is a simple cylindrical tube, provided at
its anterior end with eight (sometimes fewer) cæcal tubes, and
opening behind into the intestine. Its muscular coat consists of
a loose layer of longitudinal fibres, enclosing annular fibres.
Internal to these is a basement membrane, which supports an
epithelium consisting of elongate cells which are often clustered
into regular eminences, and separated by deep cavities. The
epithelium forms no chitinous lining in the chylific stomach or
cæcal tubes; and this peculiarity, no doubt, promotes absorption
of soluble food in this part of the alimentary canal. Short
processes are given off from the free ends of the epithelial cells,
as in the intestines of many Mammalia and other animals.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span></p>

<p>Between the cells a reticulum is often to be seen, especially
where the cells have burst; it extends between and among all
the elements of the mucous lining, and probably serves, like
the very similar structure met with in Mammalian intestines<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>
to absorb and conduct some of the products of digestion.
Different epithelial cells may be found in all the stages
noticed by Watney&mdash;viz., (1) with divided nuclei; (2) small,
newly produced cells at the base of the epithelium; (3) short
and broad cells, overtopped by the older cells around; (4) dome-shaped
masses of young cells, forming “epithelial buds”<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span>
(5) full-grown cells, ranging with those on either side, so as to
form an unbroken and uniform series. The regeneration of the<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
tissue is thus provided for. The cells come to maturity and
burst, when new cells, the product of the epithelial buds, take
their place.</p>

<p>The epithelium of the chylific stomach is continued into the
eight cæcal tubes, where it undergoes a slight modification of
form.</p>

<p>At the hinder end of the chylific stomach is a very short
tube about half the diameter of the stomach, the small
intestine. At its junction with the chylific stomach are
attached, in six bundles, 60 or 70 long and fine tubules, the
Malpighian tubules<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> The small intestine has the same general<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
structure as the œsophagus and crop; its chitinous lining is
hairy, and thrown into longitudinal folds which become much
more prominent in the lower part of the tube. The junction of
the small intestine with the colon is abrupt, and a strong
annular fold assumes the character of a circular valve (fig.&nbsp;68).</p>

<p>From the circular valve the colon extends for nearly an inch.
Its diameter is somewhat greater than that of the chylific
stomach, and uniform throughout, except for a lateral diverticulum
or cæcum, which is occasionally but not constantly present
towards its rectal end. The fore part of the colon is thrown
into a loose spiral coil. A constriction divides the colon from
the next division of the alimentary canal, the rectum.</p>

<p>The rectum is about <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> inch long, and is dilated in the middle
when distended. Six conspicuous longitudinal folds project
into the lumen of the tube. These folds are characterised by
an unusual development of the epithelium, which is altogether
wanting in the intermediate spaces, where the chitinous lining
blends with the basement-membrane, both being thrown into<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
sharp longitudinal corrugations. Between the six epithelial bands
and the muscular layer are as many triangular spaces, in which
ramify tracheal tubes and fine nerves for the supply of the
epithelium. The chitinous layer is finely setose. The muscular
layer consists of annular fibres strengthened externally by
longitudinal fibres along the interspaces between the six
primary folds<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span></p>

<p>The corrugated and non-epitheliated interspaces may be
supposed to favour distension of the rectal chamber, while the
great size of the cells of the bands of epithelium is perhaps due
to their limited extent. <span class="nowrap">Leydig<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> attributed to these rectal
bands a respiratory function, and compared them to the
epithelial folds of the rectum of Libellulid larvæ, which, as is
well known, respire by admitting fresh supplies of water into
this cavity. It is an obvious objection that Cockroaches and
other Insects in which the rectal bands are well developed do
not take water into the intestine at all. Gegenbaur has there<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>fore
modified Leydig’s hypothesis. He suggests (Grundzüge
d. Vergl. Anat.) that the functional rectal folds of Dragon-flies
and the non-functional folds of terrestrial Insects are both
survivals of tracheal gills, which were the only primitive organs
of respiration of Insects. The late appearance of the rectal
folds and the much earlier appearance of spiracles is a serious
difficulty in the way of this view, as Chun has pointed out. It
seems more probable that the respiratory appendages of the
rectum of the Dragon-fly larvæ are special adaptations to
aquatic conditions of a structure which originated in terrestrial
Insects, and had primarily nothing to do with respiration.</p>

<p>The number of the rectal bands (six) is worthy of remark.
We find six sets of folds in the gizzard and small intestine of
the Cockroach, six bundles of Malpighian tubules, with six
intermediate epitheliated bands. There are also six longitudinal
bands in the intestine of the Lobster and Crayfish. The
tendency to produce a six-banded stomodæum and proctodæum
may possibly be related to the six theoretical elements (two
tergal, two pleural, two sternal,) traceable in the Arthropod
exoskeleton, of which the proctodæum and stomodæum are
reflected folds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span></p>

<p>The anus of the Cockroach opens beneath the tenth tergum,
and between two “podical” plates. Anal glands, such as
occur in some Beetles, have not been discovered in Cockroaches.</p>


<h3><i>Appendages. The Salivary Glands.</i></h3>

<p>The three principal appendages of the alimentary canal of
the Cockroach are outgrowths of the three primary divisions of
the digestive tube; the salivary glands are diverticula of the
stomodæum, the cæcal tubes of the mesenteron, and the Malpighian
tubules of the proctodæum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<a id="Fig_71"></a><img src="images/i_p127.jpg" width="520" height="384" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 71.&mdash;Salivary Glands and Receptacle, right side. The arrow marks the open­ing
of the com­mon duct on the back of the lingua. <span class="smcap">A</span>, side view of lingua; <span class="smcap">B</span>, front
view of lingua.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A large salivary gland and reservoir lie on each side of the
œsophagus and crop. The gland is a thin foliaceous mass about
<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span>&nbsp;in. long, and composed of numerous acini, which are grouped
into two principal lobes. The efferent ducts form a trunk,
which receives a branch from a small accessory lobe, and then
unites with its fellow. The common glandular duct thus<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
formed opens into the much larger common receptacular duct,
formed by the union of paired outlets from the salivary reservoirs.
The common salivary duct opens beneath the lingua.
Each salivary reservoir is an oval sac with transparent walls,
and about half as long again as the gland. The ducts and
reservoirs have a chitinous lining, and the ducts exhibit a
transverse marking like that of a tracheal tube. When
examined with high powers the wall of the salivary gland
shows a network of protoplasm with large scattered nuclei,
resting upon a structureless chitinous membrane.</p>

<p>The salivary glands are unusually large in most Orthoptera<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span>
In other orders they are of variable occurrence and of very
unequal development.</p>


<h3><i>The Cæcal Tubes.</i></h3>

<p>There are eight (sometimes fewer) cæcal tubes arranged in a
ring round the fore end of the chylific stomach; they vary in
length, the longer ones, which are about equal to the length of
the stomach itself, usually alternating with shorter ones, though
irregularities of arrangement are common. The tubes are
diverticula of the stomach and lined by a similar epithelium.
In the living animal they are sometimes filled with a whitish
granular fluid.</p>

<p>Similar cæcal tubes, sometimes very numerous and densely
clustered, are attached to the stomach in many Crustacea and
Arachnida. The researches of Hoppe Seyler, Krukenberg,
Plateau, and others have established the digestive properties
of the fluid secreted in them, which agrees with the pancreatic
juice of Vertebrates.</p>


<h3><i>The Malpighian Tubules.</i></h3>

<p>The Malpighian tubules mark the beginning of the small
intestine, to which they properly belong. They are very
numerous (60–70) in the Cockroach, as in Locusts, Earwigs, and
Dragon-flies; and unbranched, as in most Insects. They are
about ·8 inch in length, and ·002 inch in transverse diameter,
so that they are barely visible to the naked eye as single<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
threads. In larvæ about one-fifth of an inch long, <span class="nowrap">Schindler<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span>
found only eight long tubules, the usual number in Thysanura,
Anoplura, and Termes; but the grouping into six masses, so
plainly seen in the adult, throws some doubt upon this observation.
In the adult Cockroach the long threads wind about the
abdominal cavity and its contained viscera.</p>

</div>

<p>In the wall of a Malpighian tubule there may be distinguished
(1) a connective tissue layer, with fine fibres and
nuclei; within this, (2) a basement-membrane, between which
and the connective tissue layer runs a delicate, unbranched
tracheal tube; (3) an epithelium of relatively large, nucleated
cells, in a single layer, nearly filling the tube, and leaving only
a narrow, irregular central canal. Transverse sections show
from four to ten of these cells at once. The tubules appear
transparent or yellow-white, according as they are empty or
full; sometimes they are beaded or varicose; in other cases, one
half is coloured and the other clear. The opaque contents
consist partly of crystals, which usually occur singly in the
epithelial cells, or heaped up in the central canal. Occasionally,
they form spherical concretions with a radiate arrangement.
They contain uric acid, and probably consist of urate of soda<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>
In the living Insect the tubules remove urates from the blood
which bathes the viscera; the salts are condensed and crystallised
in the epithelial cells, by whose dehiscence they pass into
the central canals of the tubules, and thence into the intestine.</p>

<p>The Malpighian tubules develop as diverticula from the
proctodæum, which is an invagination of the outer integument
and its morphological equivalent. They are, therefore, similar
in origin to urinary organs opening upon the surface of the
body and developed as invaginations of the integument, like
the “shell-glands” of lower Crustacea, and the “green glands”
of Decapod Crustacea. The segmental organs of <i>Peripatus</i>,
Annelids, and Vertebrates do not appear to be possible equivalents
of the excretory organs of Arthropods. They arise, not
as involutions, but as solid masses of mesoblastic tissue, or as
channels constricted off from the peritoneal cavity, and their
ducts have only a secondary connection with the outside of the
body or with the alimentary canal.</p>


<h3><i>Digestion of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The investigation of the digestive processes in Insects is
work of extreme difficulty, and it is not surprising that much
yet remains to be discovered. Plateau has, however, succeeded
in solving some of the more important questions, which, before
his time, had been dealt with in an incomplete or otherwise
unsatisfactory way. The experiments of Basch, though now
superseded by Plateau’s more trustworthy results, deserve
notice as first attempts to investigate the properties of the
digestive fluids of Insects.</p>

<p>Basch set out with a conviction that where a chitinous lining
is present, the epithelium of the alimentary canal secretes chitin
only, and that proper digestive juices are only elaborated in
the chylific stomach, or in the salivary glands. The tests
applied by him seemed to show that the saliva, as well as the
contents of the œsophagus and crop, had an acid reaction, while
the contents of the chylific stomach were neutral at the beginning
of the tube and alkaline further down. From this he
concluded that the supposed deep-seated glands of the chylific
stomach secreted an alkaline fluid, which neutralised the acidity<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
of the saliva. Finding that the epithelial cells of the stomach
were often loaded with oil-drops, he concluded that absorption,
at least of fats, takes place here. The chylific stomach, carefully
emptied of its contents, was found to convert starch into
sugar at ordinary temperatures. The saliva of the Cockroach
gave a similar result, and when a weak solution of hydrochloric
acid was added, Basch thought that the mixture could digest
blood-fibrin at ordinary temperatures.</p>

<p>Plateau’s researches upon <i>Periplaneta americana</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> modified by
subsequent experiments upon <i>P. orientalis</i><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> and by still more
recent observations, lead him to the following <span class="nowrap">conclusions<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span><span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1.&mdash;The saliva of the Cockroach changes starch into glucose;
but the saliva is not acid, it is either neutral (<i>P. orientalis</i>) or
alkaline (<i>P. americana</i>). Any decided acidity found in the crop
is due to the ingestion of acid food; but a very faint acidity
may occur, which results from the presence in the crop of a
fluid secreted by the cæcal diverticula of the mesenteron.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The glucose thus formed is absorbed in the crop, and no
more is formed in the succeeding parts of the digestive tube.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The function of the gizzard is that of a grating or
strainer. It has no power of trituration. If the animal consumes
vegetable food rich in cellulose, a substance not capable
of digestion in the crop, the fragments are found unaltered as
to form and size in the mesenteron. If it is supplied with
plenty of farinaceous food, such as meal or flour, the saliva is
not adequate to the complete solution and transformation of the
starch, and the intestine is found full of uninjured starch
granules, which must have traversed the gizzard without
crushing.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The cæcal diverticula secrete a feebly acid fluid. To
demonstrate its acidity an extremely sensitive litmus solution,
capable of indicating one part in twenty thousand of hydrochloric
acid, must be used. The fluid secreted by the cæca
emulsifies fats, and converts albuminoids into peptones.</p>

<p>In all Insects digestion is effected in the following way
(which is particularly easy of demonstration in <i>Carabus</i> and<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
<i>Dytiscus</i>). The crop is filled with food coarsely divided by the
mandibles, and the gizzard being shut to prevent further
passage, the fluid secretion of the cæca ascends to the crop, and
there acts upon the food. Digestion is effected in the crop, and
not beyond it. This is clear beyond doubt. In Decapod Crustacea
also it is very easy to prove that the fluid secreted by the
so-called liver ascends into the stomach (which corresponds to
the crop, together with the gizzard of the Insect). To satisfy
ourselves on this point we have only to open a Crayfish during
active digestion.</p>

<p>When digestion in the crop is finished, the gizzard relaxes,
and the contents of the crop, now in a semi-fluid condition,
pass into the mesenteron, which is devoid of chitinous lining,
and particularly fitted for absorption.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;There are no absorbent vessels properly so called, and
Plateau has long thought that the products of digestion pass by
osmosis directly through the walls of the digestive tube, to mix
with the blood in the perivisceral space. If we may rely upon
what is now known of the process in Vertebrates, we should be
led to modify this explanation. It is very likely that in Insects,
as in Vertebrates, absorption is effected by the protoplasm of
the epithelial cells, which select and appropriate certain substances
formed out of the dissolved food. Not only do the
epithelial cells transmit to the neighbouring blood-currents the
materials which they have previously absorbed, but they subject
certain kinds to further elaboration. The protoplasm of the
epithelial cells of Vertebrates is capable of forming fat. Thus,
a mixture of soap and glycerine, injected into the intestine of
a Vertebrate, is absorbed by the lacteals in the form of oil-drops.
Modern physiologists allow, too, that part of the
peptone is similarly changed into albumen, without transport to
a distance, by the activity of the epithelial lining.</p>

<p>These facts explain why Plateau was unable to isolate the
secretion of the epithelium of the chylific stomach of Insects.
The cells are not secretory, but absorbent; and the secretion
vainly sought for does not actually exist.</p>

<h3><i>Circulation of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>A very long chapter might be written upon the views advanced
by different writers as to the circulation of Insects. Malpighi
first discovered the heart or dorsal vessel in the young Silkworm.
His account is tolerably full and remarkably free from
mistakes. The heart of the Silkworm, he tells us, extends the
whole length of the body, and its pulsations are externally
visible in young larvæ. He supposed that contraction is effected<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
by muscular fibres, but these he could not distinctly see. The
tube, he says, has no single large chamber, but is formed of
many little hearts (<i>corcula</i>) leading one into another. The
number of these he could not certainly make out, but
believed that there was one to each segment of the body.
During contraction each chamber became more rounded, and
when contraction was specially energetic, the sides of the tube
appeared to meet at the constrictions. The flow of blood, he
ascertained, was forward, the rhythm not constant. No arteries
were seen to be given off from the heart<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> Swammerdam
thought that his injections ascertained the existence of vessels
branching out from the heart<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> but this proved to be a mistake.
Lyonnet added many details of interest to what was previously
known. He came to the conclusion that there was no system
of vessels connected with the heart, and even doubted whether
the organ so named was in effect a heart at all. Marcel de
Serres maintained that it was merely the secreting organ of the
fat-body. Cuvier and Dufour doubted whether any circulation,
except of air, existed in Insects. This was the extreme point of
scepticism, and naturalists were drawn back from it by Herold<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span>
who repeated and confirmed the views held by the seventeenth-century
anatomists, and insisted upon the demonstrable fact
that the dorsal vessel of an Insect does actually pulsate and
impel a current of fluid. Carus, in 1826, saw the blood flowing
in definite channels in the wings, antennæ, and legs. Straus-Durckheim
followed up this discovery by demonstrating the contractile
and valvular structures of the dorsal vessel. Blanchard
affirmed that a complex system of vessels accompanied the air
tubes throughout the body, occupying peritracheal spaces supposed
to exist between the inner and outer walls of the tracheæ.
This peritracheal circulation has not withstood critical inquiry<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span>
and it might be pronounced wholly imaginary, except for the
fact that air tubes and nerves are found here and there within
the veins of the wings of Insects.</p>

<h3><i>Heart of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>The heart of the Cockroach is a long, narrow tube, lying
immediately beneath the middle line of the thorax and abdomen.
It consists of thirteen segments (fig.&nbsp;73), which correspond to
three thoracic and ten abdominal somites. Each segment,
as a rule, ends behind in a conspicuous fold which projects
backwards from the dorsal surface; immediately in front of
this are two lateral lobes. The median lobe passes into the
angle between two adjacent terga, and is continuous with the
dorsal wall of the segment next behind, from which it is
separated only by a deep constriction, while the lateral folds
conceal paired lateral inlets<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> which lead from the pericardial
space to the hinder end of each chamber of the heart. Immediately
in front of each constriction is the interventricular valve,
a pear-shaped mass of nucleated cells, hanging down from the
upper wall of the heart, and inclining forward below. The
position of this valve indicates that during systole it closes upon
the constricted boundary between two chambers, thus shutting
off at once the inlets and the passage into the chambers behind.
In this way the progressive and rhythmical contraction of the
chambers impels a steady forward current of blood, allowing an<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
intermittent stream to enter from the pericardial space, but
preventing regurgitation.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">

</div>
</div>

<p>The wall of the heart includes several distinct layers. There
are (1) a transparent, structureless intima, only visible when
thrown into folds; (2) a partial endocardium, of scattered,
nucleated cells, which passes into the interventricular valves;
(3) a muscular layer, consisting of close-set annular, and distant
longitudinal fibres. The annular muscles are slightly interrupted
at regular and frequent intervals, and are imperfectly
joined along the middle line above and below, so as to indicate
(what has been independently proved) that the heart arises as two
half-tubes, which afterwards join along the middle. Elongate
nuclei are to be seen here and there among the muscles. The
adventitia (4), or connective tissue layer, is but slightly developed
in the adult Cockroach.</p>

<p>Within the muscular layer is a structure which we have
failed to make out to our own satisfaction. It presents the
appearance of regular but imperfect rings, which do not extend
over the upper third of the heart. They probably meet in a
ventral suture, but this and other details are hard to make out,
owing to the transparency of the parts. The rings stain with<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
difficulty, and we have not observed nuclei belonging to them.
Each extends over more than one bundle of annular muscles.</p>

<p>The difficulty of investigating a structure so minute and
delicate as the heart of an Insect may explain a good deal of the
discrepancy noted on comparing various published descriptions.
Perhaps the most obvious peculiarity which distinguishes the
heart of the Cockroach, is the subdivision of the thoracic portions
into three chambers, which, though less prominent in side-view
than the abdominal chambers, are, nevertheless, perfectly
distinct. The number of abdominal chambers is also unusually
high; but it is so easy to overlook the small chambers at the
posterior end of the abdomen, that the number given in some
of the species may have been under-estimated.</p>


<h3><i>Pericardial Diaphragm and Space.</i></h3>

<p>The heart lies in a pericardial chamber, which is bounded
above by the terga and the longitudinal tergal muscles; below
by a fenestrated membrane, the pericardial diaphragm. The
intermediate space, which is of inconsiderable depth, is nearly
filled by a cellular mass laden with fat, and resembling the
fat-body.</p>

<p>The pericardial diaphragm, or floor of the pericardium, is
continuous, except for small oval openings scattered over its
surface. It consists of loosely interwoven fibres, interspersed
with elongate nuclei (connective-tissue corpuscles) and connected
by a transparent membrane. Into the diaphragm are
inserted pairs of muscles, which, from their shape and supposed
continuity with the heart, have been named <i>alæ cordis</i>, or alary
muscles<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> These are bundles of striated muscle, about ·003&nbsp;in.
wide, which arise from the anterior margin of each tergum.
In the middle of the abdomen every alary muscle passes
inwards for about ·04&nbsp;in., without breaking-up or widening,
and then spreads out fanwise upon the diaphragm. The
fibres unite below the heart with those of the fellow-muscle, and
also join, close to the heart, those of the muscles in front and
behind. The alary muscles are often said to distend the heart
rhythmically by drawing its walls apart, but this cannot be<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
true. They do not pass into the heart at all. Even if they did,
a pull from opposite sides upon a flexible, cylindrical tube,
would narrow and not expand its cavity. Moreover, direct
<span class="nowrap">observation<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> shows that the heart continues to beat after all the
alary muscles have been divided, and even after it has been cut
in pieces. These facts suggest that the heart of Insects is innervated
by ganglia upon or within it, and indeed transparent
larvæ, such as <i>Corethra</i> or <i>Chironomus</i>, exhibit paired cells,
very like simple ganglia, along the sides of the heart.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 76.&mdash;Heart and Pericardial Diaphragm. On the right, as seen from above; on

</div>

<p>Scattered over the upper surface of the pericardial diaphragm
are groups of cells, similar to the fat-masses of the perivisceral
space. Over the fan-like expansions of the alary muscles are<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
different fat-cells, which form branched and multinucleate lobes,
and radiate in the same direction as the underlying muscles.</p>

<p>Tracheal trunks, arising close to the stigmata, ascend upon
the tergal wall towards the heart. They overlie the alary
muscles, and end near the heart by bifurcation, sending one
branch forward and another backward to meet corresponding
branches of adjacent trunks. A series of arches is thus formed
by the dorsal tracheæ on each side of the heart. Occasionally
an arch is subdivided into two smaller parallel tubes. A few
branches of distribution are given off to the fat-cells of the
pericardium.</p>

<p>Graber has explained the action of the pericardial diaphragm
and chamber in the following way<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> When the alary muscles
contract, they depress the diaphragm, which is arched upwards
when at rest. A rush of blood towards the heart is thereby set
up, and the blood streams through the perforated diaphragm
into the pericardial chamber. Here it bathes a spongy or
cavernous tissue (the fat-cells), which is largely supplied with
air tubes, and having been thus aerated, passes immediately
forwards to the heart, entering it at the moment of diastole,
which is simultaneous with the sinking of the diaphragm.</p>

<p>In the Cockroach the facts of structure do not altogether
justify this explanation. The fenestræ of the diaphragm are
mere openings without valves. The descent of a perforated non-valvular
plate can bring no pressure to bear upon the blood,
for it is not contended that the alary muscles are powerful
enough to change the figure of the abdominal rings. Moreover,
we find comparatively few tracheal tubes in the pericardial
chamber, and can discover no proof that in the Cockroach
the fat-cells adjacent to the heart have any special respiratory
character. The diaphragm appears to give mechanical
support to the heart, resisting pressure from a distended alimentary
canal, while the sheets of fat-cells, in addition to their
proper physiological office, may equalise small local pressures,
and prevent displacement. The movement of the blood towards
the heart must (we think) depend, not upon the alary muscles,
but upon the far more powerful muscles of the abdominal wall,
and upon the pumping action of the heart itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Circulation of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>The pulsations of the heart are rhythmical and usually
frequent, the number of beats in a given time varying with the
species, the age, and especially with the degree of activity or
excitement of the Insect observed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span></p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Cornelius<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> watched the pulsations in a white Cockroach
immediately after its change of skin, and reckoned them at
eighty per minute; but he remarks that the Insect was restless,
and that the beats were probably accelerated in consequence.</p>

<p>In the living Insect a wave of contraction passes rapidly
along the heart from behind forwards; and the blood may
under favourable circumstances be seen to flow in a steady,
backward stream along the pericardial sinus, to enter the lateral
aperture of the heart. The peristaltic movement of the dorsal
vessel may often be observed to set in at the hinder end of the
tube before the preceding wave has reached the aorta.</p>

<p>From the heart a slender tube (the aorta) passes forward to
the head. It lies upon the dorsal surface of the œsophagus,
which it accompanies as far as the supra-œsophageal ganglia.
In many Insects the thoracic portion of the dorsal vessel is
greatly narrowed and non-valvular, forming the aorta of most
writers on Insect Anatomy. The aorta often dips downward
near its origin, but in the Cockroach the thoracic portion of the
vessel keeps nearly the same level as the abdominal. It gives
off no lateral branches, but suddenly ends immediately in front
of the œsophageal ring in a trumpet-shaped orifice<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> by which
the blood passes at once into a lacunar system which occupies
the perivisceral space. Here the blood bathes the digestive and
reproductive organs, receives the products of digestion, which
are not transmitted by lacteals, but discharged at once into the
blood; here, too, it gives up its urates to the excretory tubules,
and its superfluous fats to the finely-divided lobules of the fat-body.
The form of the various appendages of the alimentary<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
canal (salivary glands, cæcal tubes, and Malpighian tubules), as
well as of the testes, ovaries, and fat-body, is immediately connected
with the passive behaviour of the fluid upon which their
nutrition depends. Instead of being compact organs injected
at every pulsation by blood under pressure, they are diffuse,
tubular, or branched, so as to expose as large a surface as
possible to the sluggish stream in which they float.</p>

<p>From the perivisceral space the blood enters the pericardial
sinus by the apertures in its floor, and returns thence by the
lateral inlets into the heart.</p>

<p>No satisfactory injections of the circulatory channels can be
made in Insects, on account of the large lacunæ, or cavities
without proper wall, which are interposed between the heart
and the extremities of the body. In the wings and other
transparent organs the blood has been seen to flow along
definite channels, which form a network, and resemble true
blood vessels in their arrangement. Whether they possess a
proper wall has not been ascertained. It is observed that in
such cases the course of the blood is generally forwards along
the anterior, and backwards along the posterior, side of the
appendage. The direction of the current is not, however, quite
constant, and the same cross branch may at different times
transmit blood in different directions<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Blood of the Cockroach.</i></h3>

<p>The blood of the Cockroach may be collected for examination
by cutting off one of the legs, and wiping the cut end with a
cover-slip. It abounds in large corpuscles, each of which
consists of a rounded nucleus invested by protoplasm. Amœboid
movements may often be observed, and dividing corpuscles are
occasionally seen. Crystals may be obtained by evaporating a
drop of the blood without pressure; they form radiating
clusters of pointed needles. The fresh-drawn blood is slightly
alkaline; it is colourless in the Cockroach, but milky, greenish,
or reddish in some other Insects. The quantity varies greatly,
according to the nutrition of the individual: after a few days’
starvation, nearly all the blood is absorbed. Larvæ contain much
more blood, in proportion to their weight, than other Insects.</p>

<h3><i>Respiratory Organs of Insects.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<a id="Fig_77"></a><img src="images/i_p144.jpg" width="340" height="505" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 77.&mdash;Tracheal System of Cock­roach. Side view of head seen from with­out,
intro­duc­ing the chief branches of the left half. ×&nbsp;15.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The respiratory organs of Insects consist of ramified tracheal
tubes, which communicate with the external air by stigmata or
spiracles. Of these spiracles the Cockroach has ten pairs&mdash;eight
in the abdomen and two in the thorax. The first
thoracic spiracle lies in front of the mesothorax, beneath the
edge of the tergum; the second is similarly placed in front of
the metathorax. The eight abdominal spiracles belong to the
first eight somites; each lies in the fore part of its segment,
and hence, apparently, in the interspace between two terga and
two sterna. The first abdominal spiracle is distinctly dorsal
in position.</p>

<p>The disposition of the spiracles observed in the Cockroach
is common in Insects, and, of all the recorded arrangements,
this approaches nearest to the plan of the primitive respiratory
system of Tracheata, in which there may be supposed to be
as many spiracles as somites<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> The head never carries spiracles
except in <i>Smynthurus</i>, one of the Collembola (Lubbock). Many
larvæ possess only the first of the three possible thoracic
spiracles; in perfect Insects this is rarely or never met with
(<i>Pulicidæ?</i>), but either the second, or both the second and
third, are commonly developed. Of the abdominal somites,
only the first eight ever bear spiracles, and these may be
reduced in burrowing or aquatic larvæ to one pair (the eighth),
while all disappear in the aquatic larva of <i>Ephemera</i>.</p>

<p>From the spiracles, short, wide air-tubes pass inwards, and
break up into branches, which supply the walls of the body
and all the viscera. Dorsal branches ascend towards the heart
on the upper side of the alary muscles; each bifurcates
above, and its divisions join those of the preceding and succeeding
segments, thus forming loops or arches. The principal
ventral branches take a transverse direction, and are usually
connected by large longitudinal trunks, which pass along the<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
sides of the body; the Cockroach, in addition to these, possesses
smaller longitudinal vessels, which lie close to the middle line,
on either side of the nerve-cord<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> The ultimate branches form
an intricate network of extremely delicate tubes, which penetrates
or overlies every tissue.</p>

<h3><i>Tracheal Tubes.</i></h3>

<p>The accompanying figures sufficiently explain the chief
features of the tracheal system of the Cockroach, so far as it
can be explored by simple dissection. Leaving them to tell
their own tale, we shall pass on to the minute structure
of the air-tubes, the spiracles, and the physiology of Insect
respiration.</p>

<p>The tracheal wall is a folding-in of the integument, and
agrees with it in general structure. Its inner lining, the
intima, is chitinous, and continuous with the outer cuticle. It
is secreted by an epithelium of nucleated, chitinogenous cells,
and outside this is a thin and homogeneous basement membrane.
The integument, the tracheal wall, and the inner
layers of nearly the whole alimentary canal are continuous
and equivalent structures. The lining of the larger tracheal
tubes at least is shed at every moult, like that of the stomodæum
and proctodæum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span></p>


<h3><i>Tracheal Thread.</i></h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 185px;">
<a id="Fig_84"></a><img src="images/i_p150.jpg" width="185" height="129" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 84.&mdash;Intima (chi­tin­ous lin­ing) of a large tra­cheal tube. The spir­al thread
div­ides here and there. Copied from MacLeod, loc. cit., fig.&nbsp;9.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the finest tracheal tubes (·0001&nbsp;in. and under) the intima
is to all appearance homogeneous. In wider tubes it is
strengthened by a spiral thread, which is denser, more refractive,
and more flexible than the intervening membrane. The
thread projects slightly into the lumen of the tube, and is often
branched. It is interrupted frequently, each length making
but a few turns round the tube, and ending in a point. The
thread of a branch is never continued into a main trunk. Both
the thread and the intervening membrane become invisible or
faint when the tissue is soaked with a transparent fluid, so as
to expel the air. Both, but especially the thread, absorb
colouring matter with difficulty. The thread, from its greater
thickness, offers a longer resistance to solvents, such as caustic
alkalies, and also to mechanical force; it can therefore be
readily unrolled, and often projects as a loose spiral from the
end of a torn tube, while the membrane breaks up or crumbles
away<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span></p>

<p>The large tracheal tubes close to the spiracles are without
spiral thread, and the intima is here subdivided into polygonal<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
areas, each of which is occupied by a reticulation of very fine
threads. This structure may be traced for a short distance
between the turns of the spiral thread.</p>

<p>The chitinogenous layer of the tracheal tubes is single, and
consists of polygonal, nucleated cells, forming a mosaic pattern,
but becoming irregular and even branched in the finest
branches. The cell walls are hardly to be made out without
staining. Externally, the chitinogenous cells rest upon a
delicate basement membrane.</p>

<p>Where a number of branches are given off together, the
tracheal tube may be dilated. Fine branches, such as accompany
nerves, are often sinuous. In the very finest branches
the tube loses its thread, the chitinogenous cells become
irregular, and the intima is lost in the nucleated protoplasmic
mass which replaces the regular epithelium of the wider
tubes<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Spiracles.</i></h3>

<p>The spiracles of the Cockroach are by no means of complicated
structure, but their small size, and the differences between
one spiracle and another, are difficulties which cost some pains
to overcome.</p>

</div>

<p>The first thoracic spiracle (fig.&nbsp;85) is the largest in the body.
It lies in front of the mesothorax, between the bases of the first
and second legs. It is placed obliquely, the slit being inclined
downwards and backwards, and is closed externally by a large,
slightly two-lobed valve, attached by its lower border. The
aperture immediately within the valve divides into two nearly
equal cavities, each of which leads to a separate tracheal trunk;
and between these cavities is a septum, thickened on its free
edge, against which the margin of the valve appears to close.
A special occlusor muscle arises from the integument below the
spiracle, and is inserted into a chitinous process which projects
inwardly from the centre of the valve. A second muscle, whose
connections and mode of action we have not been able to make
out satisfactorily, lies beneath the first, and is inserted into the
thickened edge of the septum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span></p>

<p>The second thoracic spiracle (fig.&nbsp;86) lies in front of the metathorax,
between the bases of the second and third legs. It is
much smaller and simpler than the first. Its valve is nearly
semi-circular, and the free border is strengthened on its deep
surface by a chitinous rim, which terminates beyond the end of
the hinge of the valve in a process which gives insertion to the
occlusor muscle.</p>

<p>The abdominal spiracles present quite a different plan of
structure. The external orifice is permanently open, owing to
the absence of valves, but communication with the tracheal trunk
may be cut off at pleasure by an internal occluding apparatus.
The external orifice leads into a shallow oval cup, which communicates
with the tracheal trunk by a narrow slit, or internal
aperture of the spiracle. The chitinous cuticle, surrounding
this internal aperture, is richly provided with setæ, which are
turned towards the opening<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> Fig.&nbsp;87<i>C</i> represents a spiracle<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
seen from within, and shows that the slit divides the cup into
two unequal lips, the smaller of which inclines away from the
middle line of the body, is movable, and is strengthened on its
deep surface by a curved chitinous rod, the “bow” of Landois.
From the opposite lip, a pouch is thrown out, which serves for
the attachment of the occlusor muscle. The muscle is inserted
into the extremity of the bow, and when it contracts, the bow is
pulled over into the position shown in fig.&nbsp;87<i>D</i>, and the opening
is closed. The antagonist muscle, which exists in all the
abdominal spiracles, is shown in fig.&nbsp;88; it arises from the<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
supporting plate of the spiracle, and is inserted opposite to the
occlusor, into the extremity of the bow.</p>

<p>Each of the eight abdominal spiracles is constructed on this
plan; the first merely differs from the others in its larger size
and dorsal position, being carried upon the lateral margin of
the first abdominal tergum, whereas the others are placed on
the side of the body, each occupying an interspace between two
terga and two sterna. The bow is of about the same length in
all; hence the apparent disproportion in the figures of different
spiracles. The external aperture of the abdominal spiracles
is oval or elliptical, placed vertically and directed backwards.</p>

<p>We have already pointed out that the wall of the air-tube,
for a short distance from the spiracular orifice, has a tesselated
instead of a spiral marking. In the thoracic spiracles the
tesselated cells are grouped round regularly placed setæ
(fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_85">85</a> <i>I</i>). The chitinous cuticle within the opening is crowded
with fine setæ, which are often arranged so as to form a fringe

<h3><i>Mechanism of Respiration.</i></h3>

<p>In animals with a complete circulation, aërated blood is diffused
throughout the body by means of arteries and capillaries,
which deliver it under pressure at all points. Such animals
usually possess a special aërating chamber (lung or gill), where
oxygen is made to combine with the hæmoglobin of the blood.
It is otherwise with Insects. Their blood escapes into great
lacunæ, where it stagnates, or flows and ebbs sluggishly, and
a diffuse form of the internal organs becomes necessary for
their free exposure to the nutritive fluid. The blood is not
injected into the tissues, but they are bathed by it, and the
compact kidney or salivary gland is represented in Insects by
tubules, or a thin sheet of finely divided lobules. By a
separate mechanism, air is carried along ramified passages to
all the tissues. Every organ is its own lung.</p>

<p>We must now consider in more detail how air is made to
enter and leave the body of an Insect. The spiracles and the
air-tubes have been described, but these are not furnished with
any means of creating suction or pressure; and the tubes
themselves, though highly elastic, are non-contractile, and
must be distended or emptied by some external force. Many
Insects, especially such as fly rapidly, exhibit rhythmical movements
of the abdomen. There is an alternate contraction and
dilatation, which may be supposed to be as capable of setting
up expirations and inspirations as the rise and fall of the
diaphragm of a Mammal. In many Insects, two sets of
muscles serve to contract the abdomen&mdash;viz., muscles which
compress or flatten, and muscles which approximate or telescope
the segments<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> In the Cockroach the second set is feebly
developed, but the first is more powerful, and causes the terga
and sterna alternately to approach and separate with a slow,
rhythmical movement; in a Dragon-fly or Humble-bee the
action is much more conspicuous, and it is easy to see that the
abdomen is bent as well as depressed at each contraction. No
special muscles exist for dilating the abdomen, and this seems
to depend entirely upon the elasticity of the parts. It was<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
long supposed that, when the abdomen contracted, air was
expelled from the body, and the air passages emptied; that
when the abdomen expanded again by its own elasticity, the
air passages were refilled, and that no other mechanism was
needed. Landois pointed out, however, that this was not
enough. Air must be forced into the furthest recesses of the
tracheal system, where the exchange of oxygen and carbonic
acid is effected more readily than in tubes lined by a dense
intima. But in these fine and intricate passages the resistance
to the passage of air is considerable, and the renewal of the air
could, to all appearance, hardly be effected at all if the inlets
remained open. Landois accordingly searched for some means
of closing the outlets, and found an elastic ring or spiral, which
surrounds the tracheal tube within the spiracle. By means of
a special muscle, this can be made to compress the tube, like
a spring clip upon a flexible gas pipe. When the muscle
contracts, the passage is closed, and the abdominal muscles can
then, it is supposed, bring any needful pressure to bear upon
the tracheal tubes, much in the same way as with ourselves,
when we close the mouth and nostrils, and then, by forcible
contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal walls, distend the
cheeks or pharynx. Landois describes the occluding apparatus
of the Cockroach as completely united with the spiracle. It
consists, according to him, of two curved rods, the “bow” and
the “band,” one of which forms each lip of the orifice. From
the middle of the band projects a blunt process for the attachment
of the occlusor muscle, which passes thence to the
extremity of the bow. The concave side of each rod is fringed
with setæ, and turned towards the opening, which lies between
the two. Upon this description of the spiracles of the Cockroach
we have to remark that there is no occluding apparatus
at all in the thoracic spiracles, which are provided with
external valves. In the abdominal spiracles the bow is perfectly
distinct, but the “band” of Landois has no separate
existence. Though the actual mechanism in this Insect does
not altogether agree with Landois’ description, it is capable
of performing the physiological office upon which he justly
lays so much stress&mdash;viz., the closing of the outlets of the
tracheal system, in order that pressure may be brought upon
the contained air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span></p>
<p>The injection of air by muscular pressure into a system of
very fine tubes may, however, appear to the reader, as it
formerly did to ourselves, extremely difficult or even impossible.
Can any pressure be applied to tubes within the body of an
Insect which will force air along the passages of (say) ·0001&nbsp;in.
diameter? It may well seem that no pressure would suffice to
distend these minute tubules, in which the actual replacement
of carbonic acid by oxygen takes place, but that the air would
either contract to a smaller volume or burst the tissues.</p>

<p>If we question the physical possibility of Landois’ explanation,
an alternative is still open to us. The late Prof. Graham
has applied the principle of Diffusion to the respiration of
animals, and has shown how by a diffusion-process the carbonic
acid produced in the remote cavities would be moved along the
smaller tubes, and emptied into wider tubes, from which it
could be expelled by muscular action. The carbonic acid is
not merely exchanged for oxygen, but for a larger volume of
oxygen (O 95 : CO<sub>2</sub> 81); and there is consequently a tendency
to accumulation within the tubes, which is counteracted by the
elasticity of the air vessels, as well as by special muscular
contractions<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span></p>

<p>Whether diffusion or injection by muscular pressure is
the chief means of effecting the interchange of gases between
the outer air and the inner tissues of the Insect, is a question
to be dealt with by physical enquiry.</p>

<p>If we suppose two reservoirs of different gases at slightly
different pressures to be connected by a capillary tube of
moderate dimensions, such as one of the larger tracheæ of the
Cockroach, transference by the molecular movements of diffusion
would be small compared with that effected by the flow
of the gas in mass. But if the single tube were replaced
by a number of others, of the same total area, but of the
fineness (say) of the pores in graphite, the flow of the gas
would be stopped, and the transference would be effected by
diffusion only. We may next consider tubes of intermediate
fineness, say a tracheal tubule of the Cockroach at the point<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
where the spiral thread ceases, and where the exchange of
gases through the wall of the tubule becomes comparatively
unobstructed. Such a tubule is about ·0001&nbsp;in. diameter. If
we may extend to such tubules the laws which hold good for
the flow of gases in capillary tubes of much greater diameter,
the quantity of air which might be transmitted in a given time
by muscular pressure of known amount can be determined.
Suppose the difference of pressure at the two ends of the tubule
to be one-hundredth of an atmosphere, and further, that the
tubule is a quarter of an inch long and ·0001&nbsp;in. diameter.
The tubule would then be cleared out every four seconds. Such
a flow of air along innumerable tubules might well suffice for
the respiratory needs of the Cockroach. Without laying too
much stress upon this calculation, for which exact data are
wanting, we may be satisfied that an appreciable quantity of
air may be made by muscular pressure to flow along even the
finer air passages of an Insect<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span></p>


<h3><i>Respiratory Movements of Insects.</i></h3>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">By FÉLIX PLATEAU, Professor in the University of Ghent.</span></p>

<p>The respiratory movements of large Insects are in general
very apparent, and many observers have said something about
what they have seen in various species. It is only since the
publication of Rathke’s memoir, however, that precise views
have been gained as to the mechanism of these movements.
This remarkable work, treating of the respiratory movements
in Insects, the movable skeletal plates, and the respiratory
muscles characteristic of all the principal groups, filled an
important blank in our knowledge. But, notwithstanding the
skill displayed in this research, many questions still remained
unanswered, which required more exact methods than mere
observation with the naked eye or the simple lens.</p>

<p>The writer, who was followed a year later by Langendorff,
conceived the idea of studying, by such graphic methods as are
now familiar, the respiratory movements of perfect Insects. He<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
has made use of two modes of investigation. The first, or graphic
method, in the strict sense of the term, consisted in recording
upon a revolving cylinder of smoked paper the respiratory
movements, transmitted by means of very light levers of Bristol
board, attached to any selected part of the Insect’s exoskeleton.
Unfortunately, this plan is only applicable to insects of more
than average size. A second method, that of projection, consisted
in introducing the Insect, carried upon a small support,
into a large magic lantern fitted with a good petroleum lamp.
When the amplification does not exceed 12 diameters, a sharp
profile may be obtained, upon which the actual displacements
may be measured, true to the fraction of a millimetre. Placing
a sheet of white paper upon the lantern screen, the outlines of
the profile are carefully traced in pencil so as to give two
superposed figures, representing the phases of inspiration and
expiration respectively. By altering the position of the Insect,
so as to obtain profiles of transverse section, or of the different
parts of the body, and, further, by gluing very small paper slips
to parts whose movements are hard to observe, the successive
positions of the slips being then drawn, complete information
is at last obtained of every detail of the respiratory movements:
nothing is lost.</p>

<p>This method, similar to that employed by the English physiologist,
Hutchinson<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> is valuable, because it enables us, with a
little practice, to investigate readily the respiratory movements
of very small Arthropods, such as Flies or Lady-birds. It has
this advantage over all others, that it leaves no room for errors
of interpretation.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with mere observation by such means as these,
of the respiratory movements of Insects, the writer has also
studied the muscles concerned, and, in common with other
physiologists (Faivre, Barlow, Luchsinger, Dönhoff, and Langendorff),
has examined the action of the various nervous centres
upon the respiratory organs. The results at which he has
arrived may be summarised as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. There is no close relation between the character of the
respiratory movements of an Insect and its position in the
zoological system. Respiratory movements are similar only<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
when the arrangement of the abdominal segments, and
especially when the disposition of the attached muscles are
almost identical. Thus, for example, the respiratory movements
of a Cockroach are different from those of other Orthoptera, but
resemble those of Hemiptera Heteroptera.</p>

<p>2. The respiratory activity of resting Insects is localised in
the abdomen. V. Graber has expressed this fact in a picturesque
form, by saying that in Insects the chest is placed at the hinder
end of the body.</p>

<p>3. In most cases the thoracic segments do not share in the
respiratory movements of an Insect at rest. Among the singular
exceptions to this rule is the Cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>), in which
the terga of the meso- and meta-thoracic segments perform
movements exactly opposite in direction to those of the
abdomen. (See fig.&nbsp;89, <i>Ms. th.</i>, <i>Mt. th.</i>)</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 89.&mdash;Profile of Cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>). The black surface represents the
expiratory contour, while the inspiratory is indicated by a thin line. The
arrows show the direction of the expiratory movement. <i>Ms. th.</i>, mesothorax;
<i>Mt. th.</i>, metathorax. Reduced from a magic-lantern projection.</p></div>
</div>

<p>4. Leaving out of account all details and all exceptions, the
respiratory movements of Insects may be said to consist of
alternate contraction and recovery of the figure of the abdomen
in two dimensions&mdash;viz., vertical and transverse. During expiration
the diameters in question are reduced, while during
respiration they revert to their previous amounts. The transverse
expiratory contraction is often slight, and may be imperceptible.
On the other hand, the vertical expiratory contraction
is never absent, and usually marked. In the Cockroach (<i>P.
orientalis</i>) it amounts to one-eighth of the depth of the abdomen
(between segments 2 and 3).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span></p>

<p>5. Three principal types of respiratory mechanism occur in
Insects, and these admit of further <span class="nowrap">subdivision:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Sterna usually stout and very convex, yielding but little.
Terga mobile, rising and sinking appreciably. To this
class belong all Coleoptera, Hemiptera Heteroptera, and
Blattina (Orthoptera).</p></div>

<div class="figcontainer">

dot­ted line shows their posi­tion after an ex­pir­ation, and the arrow marks the
direc­tion of the ex­pir­atory move­ment.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 91.&mdash;Transverse section of Abdomen, Cock­roach (<i>P. orient­alis</i>).</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Cockroach (<i>Periplaneta</i>) the sterna are slightly
raised during expiration. (See figs. 89 and 91.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Terga well developed, overlapping the sterna on the sides
of the body, and usually concealing the pleural membrane,
which forms a sunk fold. The terga and sterna approach
and recede alternately, the sterna being almost always the
more mobile. To this type belong Odonata, Diptera,
aculeate Hymenoptera, and Acridian Orthoptera. (Fig.&nbsp;92.)</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>c</i>) The pleural membrane, connecting the terga with the
sterna, is well developed and exposed on the sides of the
body. The terga and sterna approach and recede alternately,
while the pleural zone simultaneously becomes
depressed or returns to its original figure. To this type
the writer assigns the Locustidæ, the Lepidoptera and the
true Neuroptera (excluding Phryganidæ). (Fig.&nbsp;93.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>6. Contrary to the opinion once general, changes in length
of the abdomen, involving protrusion of the segments and subsequent
retraction, are rare in the normal respiration of Insects.
Such longitudinal movements extend throughout one entire
group only&mdash;viz., the aculeate Hymenoptera. Isolated examples
occur, however, in other zoological divisions.</p>

<p>7. Among Insects sufficiently powerful to give good graphic
tracings, it can be shown that the inspiratory movement is
slower than the expiratory, and that the latter is often
sudden.</p>

<p>8. In most Insects, contrary to what obtains in Mammals,
only the expiratory movement is active; inspiration is passive,
and effected by the elasticity of the body-wall.</p>

<p>9. Most Insects possess expiratory muscles only. Certain
Diptera (<i>Calliphora vomitoria</i> and <i>Eristalis tenax</i>) afford the
simplest arrangement of the expiratory muscles. In these
types they form a muscular sheet of vertical fibres, connecting
the terga with the sterna, and underlying the soft elastic membrane
which unites the hard parts of the somites. One of the<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
most frequent complications arises by the differentiation of this
sheet of vertical fibres into distinct muscles, repeated in every
segment, and becoming more and more separated as the sterna
increase in length. (See the tergo-sternal muscles of the
Cockroach, fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_36">36</a>, p.&nbsp;76.) Special inspiratory muscles occur in
Hymenoptera, Acridiidæ, and Phryganidæ.</p>

<p>10. The abdominal respiratory movements of Insects are
wholly reflex. Like other physiologists who have examined
this side of the question, the writer finds that the respiratory
movements persist in a decapitated Insect, as also after destruction
of the cerebral ganglia or œsophageal connectives; further,
that in Insects whose nervous system is not highly concentrated
(<i>e.g.</i>, Acridiidæ and Dragon-flies), the respiratory movements
persist in the completely-detached abdomen; while all external
influences which promote an increased respiratory activity in
the uninjured animal, have precisely the same action upon
Insects in which the anterior nervous centres have been
removed, upon the detached abdomen, and even upon isolated
sections of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The view formerly advocated by Faivre, that the metathoracic
ganglia play the part of special respiratory centres, must be
entirely abandoned. All carefully performed experiments on
the nervous system of Arthropoda have shown that each
ganglion of the ventral chain is a motor centre, and in Insects
a respiratory centre, for the somite to which it belongs. This
is what Barlow calls the “self-sufficiency” of the ganglia.</p>

<p class="mt2em">The writer has made similar observations upon the respiration
of Spiders and Scorpions<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> but to his great surprise he has been
unable either by direct observation, or by the graphic method,
or by projection, to discover the slightest respiratory movement
of the exterior of the body. This can only be explained by
supposing that inspiration and expiration in Pulmonate
Arachnida are intra-pulmonary, and affect only the proper
respiratory organs. The fact is less surprising because of
the wide zoological separation between Arachnida and
Insects.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span></p>

<h3><i>Respiratory Activity of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>The respiratory activity of Insects varies greatly. Warmth,
feeding, and movement are found to increase the frequency
of their respirations, and also the quantity of carbonic acid
exhaled. In Liebe’<span class="nowrap">s<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> experiments a Carabus produced ·24 mgr.
of carbonic acid per hour in September, but only ·09 mgr. per
hour in December. A rise of temperature raised the product
temporarily to twice its previous amount; but when the same
insect was kept under experiment for several days without food,
the amount fell in spite of its increased warmth. <span class="nowrap">Treviranus<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span>
gives the carbonic acid exhaled by a Humble-bee as varying
from 22 to 174, according as the temperature varied from
56° to 74°&nbsp;F.</p>

<p>Larvæ often breathe little, especially such as lie buried in
wood, earth, or the bodies of other animals. The respiration of
pupæ is also sluggish, and not a few are buried beneath the
ground or shrouded in a dense cocoon or pupa-case. Muscular
activity originates the chief demand for oxygen, and accordingly
Insects of powerful flight are most energetic in respiration.</p>

<p>A rise of temperature proportionate to respiratory activity
has been observed in many insects. <span class="nowrap">Newport<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> tells us how the
female Humble-bee places herself on the cells of pupæ ready
to emerge, and accelerates her inspirations to 120 or 130 per
minute. During these observations he found in some instances
that the temperature of a single Bee was more than 20° above
that of the outer air.</p>

<p>Some Insects can remain long without breathing. They
survive for many hours when placed in an exhausted receiver,
or in certain irrespirable gases. Cockroaches in carbonic acid
speedily become insensible, but after twelve hours’ exposure to
the pure gas they revive, and appear none the worse.
H. <span class="nowrap">Müller<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> says that an Insect, placed in a small, confined
space, absorbs <i>all</i> the oxygen. In Sir Humphry Davy’s
“Consolations in Travel<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> is a description of the Lago dei<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
Tartari, near Tivoli, a small lake whose waters are warm and
saturated with carbonic acid. Insects abound on its floating
islands; though water birds, attracted by the abundance of
food, are obliged to confine themselves to the banks, as the
carbonic acid disengaged from the surface would be fatal to
them, if they ventured to swim upon it when tranquil.</p>


<h3><i>Origin of Tracheal Respiration.</i></h3>

<p>Kowalewsky, Bütschli, and Hatschek have described the
first stages of development of the tracheal system. Lateral
pouches form in the integument; these send out anterior and
posterior extensions, which anastomose and form the longitudinal
trunks. The tracheal ramifications are not formed
by a process of direct invagination, but by the separation of
chitinogenous cells, which cohere into strings, and then form
irregular tubules. The cells secrete a chitinous lining, and
afterwards lose their distinct contours, fusing to a continuous
tissue, in which the individual cells are indicated only by their
nuclei, though by appropriate re-agents the cell boundaries can
be defined.</p>

<p>The ingenious hypothesis propounded by Gegenbaur, that
the tracheal tubes of Insects were originally adapted to aquatic
respiration, and that the stigmata arose as the scars of disused
tracheal gills, has been discussed in chap. <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">iv</a>. Semper has
<span class="nowrap">suggested<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> that tracheæ may be modified segmental organs, but
the most probable view of their origin is that put forth by
Moseley<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> that they arose as ramified cutaneous glands. In
<i>Peripatus</i> the openings are distributed irregularly over the
body; the external orifices lead to pits, from which simple
tubes, with but slight spiral markings, extend into the deeper
tissues.</p>

<p>The ovaries of the two sides of the body are separated, as in
most Insects, and consist on each side of eight tubes, four
dorsal and four ventral, which open into the inner side of a
common oviduct. The two oviducts unite behind, and form a
very short uterus. Tracheæ and fat-cells tie the ovarian tubes<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
of each side together into a spindle-shaped bundle. Each tube
is about ·4&nbsp;in. long, and has a beaded appearance, owing to the
eggs which distend its elastic wall. It gradually tapers in
front; then suddenly narrows to a very small diameter; and
lastly, joins with the extremities of the other tubes to form a
slender solid filament, which passes towards the heart, and
becomes lost in the fat-body. The wall of an ovarian tube
consists of a transparent elastic membrane, lined by epithelium,
and invested externally by a peritoneal layer of connective
tissue.</p>

fig­ure), which ulti­mate­ly form fol­licles around the ova (lower fig­ure). Copied
from Brandt, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>The epithelium of an ovarian tube presents some remarkable
peculiarities which disguise its true character. High up in the
tube, the narrow lumen is occupied by a clear protoplasm, in
which nuclei, but no cell walls, can be discerned. Where the
tube suddenly widens, large rounded and nucleated masses of
protoplasm appear, interspersed with nuclei entangled in a<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
network of protoplasm. Passing down the tube, the large
cells, which can now be recognised as eggs, arrange themselves
in a single row, to the number of about twenty. They are at
first polygonal or squarish, but gradually become cylindrical,
and finally oval. Between and around the eggs the nuclei
gradually arrange themselves into one-layered follicles, which
are attached, not to the wall of the tube, but to the eggs, and
travel downwards with them. As the eggs descend, the yolk
which they contain increases rapidly, and the germinal vesicle<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
and spot (nucleus and nucleolus), which were at first very
plain, disappear. A vitelline membrane is secreted by the
inner surface, and a chitinous chorion by the outer surface of
the egg-follicle.</p>

<p>The lowest egg in an ovarian tube is nearly or altogether of
the full size; it is of elongate-oval figure, and slightly curved,
the convexity being turned towards the uterus. It is filled
with a clear albuminous fluid, which mainly consists of yolk.
The chorion now forms a transparent yellowish capsule, which
under the microscope appears to be divided up into very many
polygonal areas, defined by rows of fine dots. These areas
probably correspond to as many follicular cells. The convex
surface of the chorion is perforated by numerous micropyles,
fine pores through which it is probable the spermatozoa gain
access to the interior of the egg.</p>

<p>The uterus has a muscular wall and a chitinous lining. Two
repeatedly branched colleterial glands open into its under side.
Of these the left is much the larger, and overlies the other.
It consists of many dichotomous tubes, some of which are a
little dilated at their blind ends. The gland is much entangled
with fat-cells, which make it difficult to unravel. The right
gland is probably of no functional importance; the left gland
is filled with a milky substance, containing many crystals and
a coagulable fluid, out of both of which the egg-capsule is
formed<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span></p>

<p>At its hinder end the uterus opens by a median vertical slit,
which lies in the 8th sternum, into a genital pouch which
represents part of the external integument, folded back far into
the interior of the abdomen. (See fig.&nbsp;96.) Upon the dorsal
wall of the genital pouch the orifice of the spermatheca is
situated<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> This is a short tube dilated at the end, and wound<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
into a spiral of about one turn. From the tube a cæcal process
is given off, which may correspond with the accessory gland
attached to the duct of the spermatheca in many Insects (<i>e.g.</i>,
Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and some Lepidoptera). The spermatheca
is filled during copulation, and is always found to contain
spermatozoa in the fertile female<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> The spermatozoa are no
doubt passed into the genital pouch from time to time, and
there fertilise the eggs descending from the ovarian tubes.</p>

</div>

<p>The external reproductive organs of the female Cockroach
belong to the 7th, 8th, and 9th somites. The 7th sternum is
incompletely divided into anterior and posterior sections, and
the posterior section is split into lateral halves. These are
joined by a flexible membrane, which admits of the wide
separation of the halves, when copulation or the passage of the
large egg-capsule renders it necessary. The vertical faces of
the membrane, which are pressed together when the parts are
at rest, are stiffened by chitinous thickenings.</p>

</div>

<p>If the succeeding sterna retained their proper place, as they
do in some Orthoptera (<i>e.g.</i>, the Mole Cricket), the 8th and 9th
sterna would project beyond the 7th, while the rectum would<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
open beneath the last tergum, and the uterus between the 8th
and 9th sterna. In the adult female Cockroach, however, the
8th and 9th somites are telescoped into the 7th, and completely
hidden by it. Their terga are reduced to narrow bands. The
8th sternum forms a semi-transparent plate which slopes downwards
and backwards, and is pierced by a vertical slit, the
outlet of the uterus. The upper edge of this sternum is hinged
upon the projecting basis of the anterior gonapophyses (to be
described immediately), and the parts form a kind of spring
joint, ordinarily closed, but capable of being opened wide upon
occasion. The 9th sternum is a small median crescentic plate,
distinct from the 8th; it supports the spermatheca, whose duct
traverses an oval plate which projects from the fore-edge of
the sternum.</p>

<p>By the telescoping of the 8th and 9th somites the sterna
take the position shown in fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_96">96</a><i>B</i>, and a new cavity, the
genital pouch, is formed by invagination. This receives the
extremity of the body of the male during copulation, while it
serves as a mould in which the egg-capsule is cast during
oviposition. Its chitinous lining resembles that of the outer<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
integument. The uterus opens into its anterior end, which is
bounded by the 8th sternum; the spermatheca opens into its
roof, which is supported by the 9th sternum and the gonapophyses;
while its floor is completed by the 7th sternum and
the infolded chitinous membrane.</p>

<p>A pair of appendages (anterior gonapophyses) are shown by
the development of the parts to belong to the 8th somite.<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
They are slender, irregularly bent, and curved inwards at the
tips. A small, forked, chitinous slip connects them with both
the 8th and 9th terga, but their principal attachment is to the
upper (properly, posterior) edge of the 8th sternum. The
anterior gonapophyses expand at their bases into broad horizontal
plates, which form part of the roof of the genital pouch.</p>

<p>Two pairs of appendages, belonging to the 9th somite, form
the posterior gonapophyses. The outer pair are relatively
large, soft, and curved: the inner narrow, hard, and straight<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span></p>

<p>The anterior gonapophyses form the lower, and the posterior
the upper jaw of a forceps, which in many Insects can be
protruded beyond the body. Some of the parts are often armed
with teeth, and the primary use of the apparatus is to bore
holes in earth or wood for the reception of the eggs. Hence
the apparatus is often called the <i>ovipositor</i>. It forms a prominent
appendage of the abdomen in such Insects as Crickets,
Saw-flies, Sirex, and Ichneumons. The sting of the Bee is a
peculiar adaptation of the same organ to a very different
purpose. In the Cockroach the ovipositor is used to grasp the
egg-capsule, while it is being formed, filled with eggs, and
hardened; and the notched edge (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, p.&nbsp;23) is the imprint
of the inner posterior gonapophyses, made while the capsule is
still soft. The shape of the parts in the male and female
indicates that the ovipositor is passive in copulation, and is
then raised to allow access to the spermatheca.</p>


<h3><i>Male Reproductive Organs.</i></h3>

<p>The male reproductive organs of Insects, in spite of very
great superficial diversity, are reducible to a common type,
which is exemplified by certain Coleoptera. The essential parts
are (1) the <i>testes</i>, which in their simplest form are paired,
convoluted tubes; more commonly they branch into many
tubules or vesiculæ, while they may become consolidated into a<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
single organ; (2) long coiled <i>vasa deferentia</i>, opening into or
close to (3) paired <i>vesiculæ seminales</i>, which discharge into
(4) the <i>ejaculatory duct</i>, a muscular tube, with chitinous lining,
by which the spermatozoa are forcibly expelled. Opening into
the vesiculæ seminales, the ejaculatory duct, or by a distinct
external orifice, may be found (5) <i>accessory glands</i>, very
variable in form, size, and number. More than one set may
occur in the same Insect. To these parts, which are rarely
deficient, are very often appended an external armature of
hooks or claspers.</p>

<p>The male Cockroach will be found to agree with this
description. It presents, however, two peculiarities which are
uncommon, though not unparalleled. In the first place the
testes are functional only in the young male. They subsequently
shrivel, and are functionally replaced by the vesiculæ seminales
and their appendages, where the later transformations of the
sperm-cells are effected. The atrophied testes are nevertheless
sufficiently large in the adult to be easily made out. Secondly,
the accessory glands are numerous, and differ both in function
and insertion. Two sets are attached to the vesiculæ seminales,
and the fore end of the ejaculatory duct (<i>utriculi majores</i> and
<i>breviores</i>); another large conglobate gland opens separately to
the exterior. We shall now describe the structure of these parts
in more detail<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<a id="Fig_100"></a><img src="images/i_p177.jpg" width="330" height="292" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 100.&mdash;Male Organs, side view. <i>T<sup>7</sup></i>, seventh ter­gum; <i>S<sup>7</sup></i>, seventh ster­num;

</div>

<p>The testes may be found in older larvæ or adults beneath
the fifth and sixth terga of the abdomen. They lie in the
fat-body, from which they are not very readily distinguished.
Each testis consists of 30–40 rounded vesicles attached by
short tubes to the vas deferens<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> The wall of the testis<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
consists of a peritoneal layer and an epithelium, which is folded
inwards along transverse lines. The cells of the epithelium
give rise to spermatocysts<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> which enclose sperm cells. By
division of the nuclei of the sperm cells spermatozoa are
formed, which have at first nucleated heads and long tails.<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
Subsequently the enlarged heads disappear. The spermatozoa
move actively. In adult males the testes undergo atrophy,
but can with care be discovered in the enveloping fat-body.</p>

<p>The vasa deferentia are about ·25 inch in length. They pass
backwards from the testes, then turn downwards on each side
of the large intestine, and finally curve upwards and forwards,
entering the vesiculæ seminales on their dorsal side. Each vas
deferens divides once or twice into branches, which immediately
reunite; in the last larval stage the termination of the passage
dilates into a rounded, transparent vesicle.</p>

<p>The vesiculæ seminales are simple, rounded lobes in the
pupa (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_101">101</a>), but their appearance is greatly altered in the
adult by the development of two sets of utricles (modified
accessory glands). The longer utricles (<i>utriculi majores</i>) open
separately into the sides of the vesiculæ; nearer to the middle
line are the shorter and more numerous <i>utriculi breviores</i>, which
open into the fore part of the vesiculæ.</p>

<p>The utricles form the “mushroom-shaped gland” of Huxley,
which was long described as the testis. In the adult male the
utricles are usually distended with spermatozoa, and of a
brilliant opaque white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span></p>

<p>The ejaculatory duct is about ·15 inch long, and overlies
the 6th-9th sterna. It is wide in front, where it receives the
paired outlets of the vesiculæ seminales. Further back it
narrows, and widens again near to its outlet, which we find to
be between the external chitinous parts, and not into the penis,
as described by Brehm. The duct possesses a muscular wall
for the forcible ejection of its contents, and in accordance with
its origin as a folding-in of the outer surface, it is provided
with a chitinous lining. In the adult the fore part of the duct
may be distended with spermatozoa.</p>

<p>The ejaculatory duct is originally double (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_194">194</a>), and its
internal cavity is still subdivided in the last larval stage or
so-called “pupa.”</p>

<p>Upon the ventral surface of the ejaculatory duct lies an
accessory gland of unknown function; it is “composed of
dichotomous, monilated tubes, lined by a columnar epithelium,
all bound together by a common investment into a flattened,
elongated mass.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> The duct of this gland does not enter the
penis, as described by Brehm, but opens upon a double hook,
which forms part of the external genital armature (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_99">99</a>, 3).
It may be convenient to distinguish this as the “conglobate
gland.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span></p>

<p>The external reproductive organs of the male Cockroach are
concealed within the 9th sternum. The so-called penis (fig.&nbsp;102)
is long, slender, and dilated at the end. It is not perforated,
and we do not understand its use, though it probably conveys
the semen.</p>

<p>The “titillator” (Brunner von Wattenwyl) is a solid curved
hook with a hollow base. Besides these, are several odd-shaped,
unsymmetrical pieces (fig.&nbsp;102, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>), moved by special
muscles. A pair of styles (see figs. <a href="#Fig_32">32</a>–3 and 103) project from
the hinder edge of the 9th sternum. These paired and unpaired
appendages are believed to open the genital pouch of the female,
but we do not understand their action in detail<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span></p>

<p>Brehm observes that the male reproductive organs of the
Cockroach are most nearly paralleled by those of the Mantidæ.
A free penis occurs in all Orthoptera, except Acridiidæ and
Phasmidæ.</p>

<p>The male organs of the House Cricket will be found much
easier to understand than those of the Cockroach. The testes
are of irregular, oval figure, the vasa deferentia very long,<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
tortuous, and enlarged towards the middle of their length.
The vesiculæ seminales bear many utriculi majores et breviores.
The penis is of simple form, and dilated at the end. The
titillator is broad, but produced into a slender prong, which
projects beyond the penis. A pair of subanal styles is found,
but the unpaired hooklets are wanting or very inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Very little is known about the act of copulation among Cockroaches,
and the opportunities of observation are few. The
following account is given by Cornelius (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p.&nbsp;22)<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The male and female Cockroaches associate in pairs, the females being
generally quiet. The male, on the contrary, bustles about the female,
runs round her, trailing his extended abdomen on the ground, and now
and then raises his wings. If the female moves away, the male stops the
road. At last, when the female has become perfectly still, the male goes
in front of her, brings the end of his abdomen towards her, then moves
backwards, and pushes his whole length under the female. The operation
is so rapid that it is impossible to give an exact account of the circumstances.
Then the male creeps out from beneath the female, raises high
both pairs of wings, depresses them again, and goes off, while the female
usually remains quiet for some time.”</p></div>

<h3><i>The Embryonic Development of the Cockroach.</i>&#8239;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></h3>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">By JOSEPH NUSBAUM, Magister of Zoology, Warsaw.</span></p>

<p>The development of the Cockroach is by no means an easy
study. It costs some pains to find an accessible place in which
the females regularly lay their eggs, and the opaque capsule
renders it hard to tell in what stage of growth the contained
embryos will be found. Accordingly, though the development
of the Cockroach has lately attracted some observers, the<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
inexperienced embryologist will find it more profitable to
examine the eggs of Bees, of Aphides, or of such Diptera as lay
their eggs in water.</p>

<p>The Cockroach is developed, like most animals, from fertilised
eggs<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> The eggs of various animals differ much in size and
form, but always contain a formative plasma or egg-protoplasm,
a germinal vesicle (<i>nucleus</i>), and a germinal
spot (<i>nucleolus</i>). Besides these essential parts, eggs also always
contain a greater or less quantity of food-yolk, which serves
for the supply of the developing embryo. The quantity of
this yolk may be small, and its granules are then uniformly
dispersed through the egg-protoplasm; or very considerable,
in which case the protoplasm and yolk become more or less
sharply defined. Eggs of the first kind are known as <i>holoblastic</i>,
those of the second kind as <i>meroblastic</i>, names suggested by the
complete or partial segmentation which these kinds of eggs
respectively undergo. When the food-yolk is very abundant it
does not at first (and in some cases does not at any time)
exhibit the phenomena of growth, such as cell-division. If, on
the other hand, the yolk is scanty and evenly dispersed through
the egg-protoplasm, the segmentation proceeds regularly and
completely. The eggs of Arthropoda, including those of the
Cockroach, are meroblastic.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Cockroach (<i>P. orientalis</i>) are enclosed (see
p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_23">23</a>) sixteen together in stout capsules of horny consistence.
They are adapted to the form of the capsule, laterally compressed,
convex on the outer, and concave on the inner side.
The ventral surface of the embryo lies towards the inner,
concave surface of the egg. Each egg is provided with a very
thin brownish shell (<i>chorion</i>), whose surface is ornamented with
small six-sided projections. In young eggs, still enclosed within
the ovary, the nucleus (<i>germinal vesicle</i>) and nucleolus (<i>germinal
spot</i>) can be plainly seen, but by the time they are ready for
deposition within the capsule, so large a quantity of food-yolk,
at first finely&mdash;afterwards coarsely&mdash;granular, accumulates
within them, that the germinal vesicle and spot cease to be
visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span></p>

<p>Since the yolk of the newly-laid egg of the Cockroach is of
a consistence extremely unfavourable to hardening and microscopic
investigation, I have not been able to obtain transverse
sections of the germinal vesicle, nor to study the mode of its
division (segmentation). If, however, we may judge from
what other observers have found in the eggs of Insects more
suitable for investigation than those of the Cockroach, we shall
be led to conclude that a germinal vesicle, with a germinal spot
surrounded by a thin layer of protoplasm, lies within the nutritive
yolk of the Cockroach egg. From this protoplasm all the
cells of the embryo are derived.</p>

</div>

<p>The germinal vesicle, together with the surrounding protoplasm,
undergoes a process of division or segmentation. Some
of the cells thus formed travel towards the surface of the egg
to form a thin layer of flattened cells investing the yolk, the
so-called <i>blastoderm</i>, while others remain scattered through the
yolk, and constitute the yolk-cells (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_107">107</a>).</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 105.&mdash;Ventral Plate of <i>B. ger­man­ica</i>, side view. ×&nbsp;20.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the future ventral side of the embryo (and therefore on
the concave surface of the egg) the cells of the blastoderm
become columnar, and here is formed the so-called ventral
plate, the first indication of the embryo. This is a long narrow
flattened structure (fig.&nbsp;104). It is wider in front where the head
segment is situated; further back it becomes divided by many
transverse lines into the primitive segments. The total number
of segments in the ventral plate of Insects is usually seventeen<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span>
Indications of the appendages appear very early. They give
rise to an unpaired labrum, paired antennæ, mandibles, and
maxillæ (two pairs). The first and second pair of maxillæ have
originally, according to Patten<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> two and three branches respectively.
Behind the mouth-parts are found three rudimentary
legs. Upon all the abdominal segments, according to Patten,
rudimentary limbs are formed; but these soon disappear, except
one pair, which persists for a time in the form of a knobbed stalk;
subsequently this, too, completely disappears. Three or four of
the hindmost segments curve under the ventral surface of the
embryo, and apparently (?) give rise to the modified segments
and appendages of the extremity of the abdomen (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_105">105</a>). The
ventral plate lies at first directly beneath the egg membrane
(chorion), but afterwards becomes sunk in the yolk, so that a
portion of the yolk makes its way between the ventral plate
and the chorion. Whilst this portion of the yolk is perfectly
homogeneous, the remainder, placed internally to it, becomes
coarsely granular, and encloses many roundish cavities and<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
yolk-cells. The middle region of the body is more deeply sunk
in the yolk than the two ends, and the embryo thus assumes a
curved position (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_105">105</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>This curvature of the embryo is closely connected with the
formation of the embryonic membranes. On either side of the
ventral plate a fold of the blastoderm arises, and these folds
grow towards each other beneath the chorion. Ultimately they
meet along the middle line of the ventral plate (fig.&nbsp;106),
and thus form a double investment, the outer layer being the
<i>serous envelope</i>, the inner the <i>amnion</i>. Between the two the
yolk passes in, as has been explained above (fig.&nbsp;107).</p>

<p>At the same time that the embryonic membranes are forming,
the embryonic layers make their appearance. The ventral
plate, which was originally one-layered, forms the <i>epiblast</i> or
outer layer of the embryo, and from this are subsequently
derived the middle layer (<i>mesoblast</i>) and the deep layer
(<i>hypoblast</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>As to the origin of the mesoblast most observers have <span class="nowrap">found<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span>
that a long groove (the <i>germinal groove</i>) appears in the middle
line of the ventral plate (fig.&nbsp;108), which bulges into the
yolk, gradually detaches itself from the epiblast, and completes
itself into a tube. The lumen of this tube soon becomes filled
with cells, and the solid cellular mass thus formed divides into
two longitudinal tracts, which lie right and left of the middle
line of the ventral plate beneath the epiblast, and are known as
the <i>mesoblastic bands</i>. In the Cockroach I was able to satisfy
myself that in this Insect also, the mesoblast, in all probability,
arises by the formation and closure of a similar groove of the
epiblast. <i>M</i> (fig.&nbsp;108) represents the stage in which the lumen
of the groove has disappeared, and the mesoblast forms a solid
cellular mass.</p>

<p>The origin of the hypoblast in Insects has not as yet been
clearly determined. Two quite different views on this subject
have found support. Some observers (Bobretsky, Graber, and
others) maintain that the hypoblast originates in the yolk-cells,
which form a superficial layer investing the rest of the yolk.
Others (especially <span class="nowrap">Kowalewsky<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span>) believe that the process is
altogether different. According to the latest observations of
the eminent embryologist just named, upon the development of
the <i>Muscidæ</i>, the germinal groove gives rise, not only to the<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
two mesoblastic bands, but also, in its central region, to the
hypoblast. This makes its appearance, however, not as a
continuous layer, but as two hourglass-shaped rudiments, one at
the anterior, the other at the posterior end of the ventral plate.
These rudiments have their convex ends directed away from
each other, while their edges are approximated and gradually
meet so as to form a continuous hypoblast beneath the mesoblast.
Although I have not been able completely to satisfy
myself as to the mode of formation of the hypoblast in the
Cockroach, I have observed stages of development which lead
me to suppose that it proceeds in this Insect in a manner
similar to that observed by Kowalewsky in <i>Muscidæ</i>. The
hourglass-shaped rudiments of the hypoblast become pushed
upwards by those foldings-in of the epiblast which form
towards the anterior and posterior ends of the embryo, and give
rise to the stomodæum and proctodæum<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span></p>

<p>The stage of development in which the germinal groove
appears, by the folding inwards of the epiblast, has been
observed in many other animals, and is known as the Gastræa-stage.
In all higher types (Vertebrates, the higher Worms,
Arthropoda, Echinodermata) the mesoblast and hypoblast are
formed in the folded-in part of the Gastræa in a manner
similar to that observed in Insects.</p>

<p>The yolk-cells, which some observers have supposed to form
the hypoblast, are believed by Kowalewsky to have no other
function except that of the disintegration and solution of the
yolk. I can, however, with confidence affirm that in the Cockroach
these cells take part in the formation of permanent
tissues (see below).</p>

<p>Each of the two mesoblastic bands which lie right and left of
the germinal groove divides into many successive somites, and
each of these becomes hollow. Every such somite consists of
an inner (dorsal) one-layered and an outer (ventral) many-layered
wall, the latter being in contact with the epiblast. The
cavities of all the somites unite to form a common cavity, the
<i>cœlom</i> or perivisceral space of the Cockroach. The cœlom, like
the cavities in which it originates, is bounded by two layers of
mesoblast&mdash;an inner, the so-called <i>splanchnic</i> or visceral layer,<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
which lies on the outer side of the hypoblast, and an outer
<i>somatic</i> or parietal layer, beneath the epiblast. There are
accordingly four layers in the Cockroach-embryo&mdash;viz., (1) <i>epiblast</i>,
from which the integument and nervous system are
developed; (2) <i>somatic layer of mesoblast</i>, mainly converted into
the muscles of the body-wall; (3) <i>splanchnic layer of mesoblast</i>,
yielding the muscular coat of the alimentary canal; and (4)
<i>hypoblast</i>, yielding the epithelium of the mesenteron.</p>

</div>

<p>Scattered yolk-cells associate themselves with the mesoblast
cells, so that the constituents of the mesoblast have a two-fold
origin. Fig.&nbsp;109 shows that the yolk-cells are large, finely
granular, and provided with many (3–6) nuclei and nucleoli.
They send out many branching protoplasmic threads, which
connect the different cells together, and thus form a cellular
network. Certain cells separate themselves from the rest, apply
themselves to the walls of the somites, and form a provisional<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
diaphragm (fig.&nbsp;110, <i>D</i>) consisting of a layer of flattened cells<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span>
other cells (fig.&nbsp;109) pass into and through the walls of the
somites, and reach their central cavity, where they increase in
number and blend with the mesoblast cells. What finally
becomes of them I cannot say; perhaps they form the fat-body.</p>

<p>The ventral plate occupies, as I have explained, the future
ventral surface of the Insect, and here only at first both the
embryonic membranes are to be met with. On the sides and
above the yolk is invested by the serous envelope alone. The
ventral plate, however, gradually extends upwards upon the
sides of the egg, in the directions of the arrows (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_107">107</a>), and
finally closes upon the dorsal surface of the embryo, so as completely
to invest the whole yolk. Every segment of the
embryo shows at a certain stage numerous clusters of spherical
granules, which according to Patten (loc. cit.) are composed of
urates (fig.&nbsp;111, <i>S</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span></p>

<p>We shall now proceed to consider the development of the
several organs of the Cockroach.</p>

Leydig); <i>Ch</i>, cellular band; <i>N</i>′ <i>N</i>″ inner and outer neurilemma.</p></div>
</div>

<p><i>Nervous System.</i>&mdash;Along the middle line of the whole ventral
surface there is formed a somewhat deep groove-like infolding
of the epiblast, bounded on either side by paired solid thickenings,
which detach themselves from the epiblast (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_110">110</a>, <i>N</i>) and
constitute the double nervous chain. In many other Insects a
median cord (from which are derived the transverse interganglionic
commissures) forms along the bottom of the nervous
fold. This secondary median fold is very inconspicuous and
slightly developed in the Cockroach, so that the transverse
commissures between the developing ganglia are mainly contributed
by the cellular substance of the lateral nervous band.
The brain is formed out of two epiblastic thickenings which
occupy shallow depressions. The so-called <i>inner neurilemma</i>,
which surrounds the ventral nerve-cord, is developed as follows:&mdash;Along
the ventral nerve-cord, and between its lateral halves,
a small solid cellular band (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_110">110</a>, <i>Ch</i>) is developed out of the
mesoblastic diaphragm described above. This grows round
the ventral nerve-cord on all sides (fig.&nbsp;112, <i>N</i>′), passing also
inwards between the central fibrillar tract and the outer<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
cellular layer, and thus forming the thin membrane which
invests the central nervous mass (fig.&nbsp;112, <i>N</i>″). The above-mentioned
solid mesoblastic band, which exists for a very
short time only, may perhaps be homologised with the
chorda dorsalis of Vertebrates, and the chorda of the higher
Worms, since in these types also the chorda forms a solid
cellular band of meso-hypoblastic origin, lying between the
nervous system and the hypoblast. The peripheral nerves arise
as direct prolongations of the fibrillar substance of the nerve-cord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Alimentary Canal.</i>&mdash;The epithelium of the mesenteron is
formed out of the hypoblast, whose cells assume a cubical form
and gradually absorb the yolk. The epithelium of the stomodæum
and proctodæum is derived, however, from two epiblastic
involutions at the fore and hind ends of the embryo. The
muscular coat of the alimentary canal is contributed by the
splanchnic layer of the mesoblast. The mesenteron in an
early stage of development appears as an oval sac of greenish
colour (fig.&nbsp;113), faintly seen through the body-wall. The cæcal
tubes are extensions of the mesenteron, the Malpighian tubules
of the proctodæum. The epiblastic invaginations may be
recognised in all stages of growth by their chitinous lining
and layer of chitinogenous cells, continuous with the similar
layers in the external integument.</p>

<p><i>Tracheal System.</i>&mdash;Tubular infoldings of the epiblast, forming
at regular intervals along the sides of the embryo and projecting
into the somatic mesoblast, give rise to the paired tracheal
tubes, which are at first simple and distinct from one another<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span></p>

<p><i>Heart.</i>&mdash;The wall of the heart in Insects is of mesoblastic
origin, and develops from paired rudiments derived from that
peripheral part of each mesoblastic band which unites the
somatic to the splanchnic layer. In this layer two lateral
semi-cylindrical rudiments appear, which, as the mesoblastic
bands meet on the dorsal surface of the embryo, are brought
into contact and unite to form the heart (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_111">111</a>). The heart is
therefore hollow from the first, its cavity not being constricted
off from the permanent perivisceral space enclosed by the
mesoblast, but being a vestige of the primitive embryonic
blastocœl, which is bounded by the epiblast, as well as by the
two other embryonic layers. Such a mode of the development
of the heart was observed by Bütschli in the Bee, and by
Korotneff in the Mole Cricket. I am convinced, from my own
observations, that the heart of the Cockroach originates in this
way, though it is to be observed that, in consequence of<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
Patten’s results<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> the question requires further investigation.
According to Patten the mesoblastic layers of the embryo
pulsate rhythmically long before the formation of the heart.
Patten also states that the blood-corpuscles are partially derived
from the wall of the heart.</p>

<p><i>Reproductive Organs.</i>&mdash;In <i>P. orientalis</i> the reproductive organs
are developed as follows:&mdash;The reproductive glands have a
mesoblastic origin. The immature ovaries and testes take the
form of elongate oval bodies, which prolong themselves backwards
into a long thin thread-like cord or ligament (figs.
114, 115). These lie in the perivisceral space, between the
somatic and splanchnic layers of the mesoblast, and on the
sides of the abdomen. The glands divide tolerably early into
chambers, which have, however, a communicating passage (figs.<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
114, 115). From their backward-directed prolongations arises
the epithelium of the vasa deferentia and oviducts. All other
parts of the reproductive ducts are developed out of tegumentary
thickenings of the ventral surface in the last abdominal
segment, and the last but one. These thickenings are at first
paired<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span> but afterwards blend to form single organs (fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_118">118</a>).
Within the tegumentary thickenings just described, there
appear in the male Cockroach two anterior closed cavities
which unite to form the single cavity of the permanent mushroom-shaped
body (<i>vesicula seminalis</i>). A posterior cavity
becomes specialised as the ductus ejaculatorius, while the hindmost
part of the thickening, which is at first double, afterwards
by coalescence single, forms the penis (figs. 117, 118). The<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
accessory reproductive glands have also a tegumentary origin.
In the female Cockroach the chitinogenous epithelium of the
integument gives rise to the uterus, vagina<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> and accessory
glands, the muscular and connective tissue layers of the sexual
apparatus being formed out of loose mesoblastic cells<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Post-embryonic Development.</i></h3>
<p>At the time of hatching the Cockroach resembles its parent
in all essentials, the wings being the only organs which are
developed subsequently, not as entirely new parts, but as extensions
of the lateral edges of the thoracic terga. The mode of
life of the young Cockroach is like that of the adult, and
development may be said to be direct, or with only a trifling
amount of metamorphosis. In the Thysanura even this
small post-embryonic change ceases to appear, and the Insect,
when it leaves the egg, differs from its parent only in size. It
is probable that development without metamorphosis was once
the rule among Insects. At present such is by no means the
case. Insects furnish the most familiar and striking, though,
as will appear by-and-by, not the most typical examples of
development with metamorphosis. In many text-books the
quiescent pupa and the winged imago are not unnaturally
described as normal stages, which are exceptionally wanting in
Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Thysanura, and other “ametabolous”
Insects. It is, however, really the “holometabolous” Insects
undergoing what is called “complete metamorphosis,”
which are exceptional, deviating not only from such little-specialised
orders as Thysanura and Orthoptera, but from nearly
all animals which exhibit a marked degree of metamorphosis.
We shall endeavour to make good this statement, and to show
that the Cockroach is normal in its absence of conspicuous
post-embryonic change, while the Butterfly, Bee, Beetle, and
Gnat are peculiar even among metamorphic animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span></p>

<h3><i>Animal Metamorphoses.</i></h3>
<p>To investigate the causes of metamorphosis, let us select from
the same sub-kingdom two animals as unlike as possible
with respect to the amount of post-embryonic change to which
they are subject. We can find no better examples than
Amphioxus and the Chick.</p>

<p>The newly-hatched Amphioxus is a small, two-layered,
hollow sac, which moves through the sea by the play of cilia
which project everywhere from its outer surface. It is a
Gastræa, a little simpler than the Hydra, and far simpler than
a Jelly-fish. As yet it possesses no nervous system, heart,
respiratory organs, or skeleton. The most expert zoologist,
ignorant of its life-history, could not determine its zoological
position. He would most likely guess that it would turn either
into a polyp or a worm.</p>

<p>The Chick, on the other hand, at the tenth day of incubation,
is already a Bird, with feathers, wings, and beak. When it
chips the shell it is a young fowl. It has the skull, the skeleton,
the toes, and the bill characteristic of its kind, and no
child would hesitate to call it a young Bird.</p>

<p>Amphioxus is, therefore, a Vertebrate (if for shortness we
may so name a creature without vertebræ, brain, or skull),
which develops with metamorphosis, being at first altogether
unlike its parent. The Chick is a Vertebrate which develops
directly, without metamorphosis. Let us now ask what other
peculiarities go with this difference in mode of development.</p>

<p>Amphioxus produces many small eggs (<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">10</span></span></span>&nbsp;mm. in diameter)
without distinct yolk, and consequently segmenting regularly.
The adult is of small size (2 to 3&nbsp;in. long), far beneath the
Chick in zoological rank, and of marine habitat.</p>

<p>The Fowl lays one egg at once, which is of enormous size
and provided with abundant yolk, hence undergoing partial
segmentation. The Fowl is much bigger than Amphioxus,
much higher in the animal scale, and of terrestrial habitat.</p>

<p>Which of the peculiarities thus associated governs the rest?
Is it the number or size of the eggs? Or the size, zoological
rank, or habitat of the adult? The question cannot be answered
without a wider collection of examples. Let us run over the
<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
great divisions of the Animal Kingdom, and collect all the facts
which seem to be significant. We may omit the Protozoa,
which never develop multicellular tissues, and in which segmentation
and all subsequent development are therefore
absent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porifera</span> (Sponges).&mdash;Nearly all marine and undergoing
metamorphosis, the larva being wholly or partially ciliated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cœlenterates</span> undergo metamorphosis, the immediate product
of the ovum being nearly always a <i>planula</i>, or two-layered
hollow sac, usually devoid of a mouth, and moving about by
external cilia. In many Cœlenterates the complicated process
of development known as Alternation of Generations occurs.
The sedentary Anemones pass through a planula stage, but
within the body of the parent. Among the few Cœlenterates
which have no free planula stage is the one truly fluviatile
genus&mdash;Hydra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worms</span> are remarkable for the difference between closely
allied forms with respect to the presence or absence of metamorphosis.
The non-parasitic freshwater and terrestrial
Worms, however (<i>e.g.</i>, Earthworms, Leeches, all freshwater
Dendrocœla, and Rhabdocœla), do not undergo metamorphosis.
In the parasitic forms complicated metamorphosis is common,
and may be explained by the extraordinary difficulties often
encountered in gaining access to the body of a new host.</p>

<p>All <span class="smcap">Polyzoa</span> are aquatic (fluviatile or marine), and all produce
ciliated embryos, unlike the parent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brachiopoda</span> are all marine, and produce ciliated embryos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Echinoderms</span> usually undergo striking metamorphosis, but
certain viviparous or marsupial forms develop directly. There
are no fluviatile or terrestrial Echinoderms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamellibranchiate Mollusca</span> have peculiar locomotive
larvæ, provided with a ring of cilia, and usually with a long
vibratile lash. These temporary organs are reduced or suppressed
in the freshwater forms. There are no terrestrial
Lamellibranchs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snails</span> have also a temporary ciliated band, but in the freshwater
species it is slightly developed (<i>Limnæus</i>), and it is totally
wanting in the terrestrial <i>Helicidæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cephalopoda</span>, which are all marine, have no ciliated band,
and the post-embryonic changes do not amount to metamorphosis.
There is usually a much larger yolk-sac than in other
Mollusca.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crustacea</span> usually pass through well-marked phases. <i>Peneus</i>
presents five stages of growth (including the adult), the earlier
being common to many lower Crustacea. The Crab passes
through three, beginning with the third of <i>Peneus</i>; the Lobster
through two; while the freshwater Crayfish, when hatched, is
already in the fifth and last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fishes</span> seldom undergo any post-embryonic change amounting
to metamorphosis. <i>Amphioxus</i> (if <i>Amphioxus</i> be indeed a
fish) is the only well-marked case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amphibia</span> develop without conspicuous metamorphosis, except
in the case of the Frogs and Toads (Anura), which begin life
as aquatic, tailed, gill-bearing, and footless tadpoles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reptiles</span>, <span class="smcap">Birds</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mammals</span> do not undergo transformation.</p>

<p>This survey, hasty as it necessarily is, shows that habitat is a
material circumstance. Larval stages are apt to be suppressed
in fluviatile and terrestrial forms. Further, it would seem that
zoological rank is not without influence. Metamorphosis is
absent in Cephalopoda, the highest class of Mollusca, and in all
but the lowest Vertebrates, while it is almost universal in
Cœlenterates, Echinoderms, and Lamellibranchs.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that the quantity of food-yolk
indicates the course of development. If a large store of food
has been laid up for the young animal, it can continue its
growth without any effort of its own, and it leaves the egg well
equipped for the battle of life. Where there is little or no
yolk, the embryo is turned out in an ill-furnished condition to
seek its own food. This early liberation implies metamorphosis,
for the small and feeble larva must make use of temporary
organs. Some very simple locomotive appendages are almost
universally needed, to enable it to get away from the place of its
birth, which is usually stocked with as much life as it can support.</p>

<p>Some animals, therefore, are like well-to-do people, who can
provide their children with food, clothes, schooling, and pocket-money.
Their fortunate offspring grow at ease, and are not
<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
driven to premature exercise of their limbs or wits. Others are
like starving families, which are forced to send their children
to sell matches or newspapers in the streets. It is a question of
the amount of capital or accumulated food which is at command.</p>

<p>The connection between zoological rank and the absence of
metamorphosis is also explained by what we see among men.
High zoological position ordinarily implies strength or intelligence,
and the strong and knowing can do better for their
offspring than the puny and sluggish. It does not cost a Shark
or a quadruped too much to hatch its young in its own body,
while Spiders and Earwigs<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> which are among the highest
Invertebrates, defend their progeny, as do Mammals and Birds,
the highest Vertebrates.</p>

<p>But what has all this to do with habitat? Are fluviatile and
terrestrial animals, as a rule, better off than marine animals?
Possibly they are. In the confined and isolated fresh waters at
least, the struggle for existence is undoubtedly less severe than
<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
in the waters of the sea. This is shown by the slow rate of
change in freshwater types. Many of our genera of land and
freshwater shells date back at least as far as to Purbeck and
Wealden times, while our common pond-mussel is represented
in the Coal Measures. The comparative security of fresh
waters is probably the reason why so many marine fishes enter
rivers to spawn.</p>

<p>More important, and less open to question, is the direct action
of the sphere of life. The cheap method of turning the
embryo out to shift for itself can seldom be practised with
success on land. But in water floating is easy, and swimming
not difficult. A very slightly-built larva can move about by
means of cilia, and a whole brood can disperse far and wide in
search of food, while still in a mere planula condition&mdash;hollow
sacs, without mouth, nerves, or sense-organs. Afterwards the
little locomotive larva settles down, opens a mouth, and begins
to feed. Nearly the whole of its development is carried on at
its own charge.</p>

<p>The extra risks to which marine animals are exposed also
tell in favour of transformation, for they are met by an increase
in the number of ova. Marine species commonly lay more eggs
than freshwater animals of like habits. The Cod is said to
produce nine million eggs; the Salmon from twenty to thirty
thousand; the Stickleback only about one hundred, which are
guarded during hatching by the male. The Siluroid fish, <i>Arius</i>,
lays a very few eggs, as big as small cherries, which the male
carries about in his mouth.</p>

<p>Without laying stress upon such figures as these, which
cannot be impartially selected, we can safely affirm that marine
forms are commonly far more prolific than their freshwater
allies. But high numbers increase the difficulty of providing
yolk for each, and thus tend to early exclusion, and subsequent
transformation. We may rationally connect marine habitat
with small eggs, poorly supplied with yolk, segmenting regularly,
and producing larva which develop with metamorphosis.</p>

<p>In fresh waters dispersal can seldom be very effective. The
area is usually small, and communicates with other freshwater
basins only through the sea. Migration to a considerable distance
is usually impossible, and migration to a trifling distance use
<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>less.
Moreover, competition is not too severe to prevent some
accumulation of food by the parent on behalf of the family.</p>

<p>On land the conditions are still less favourable to larval
transformation. Very early migration is altogether impossible.
Any kind of locomotion by land implies muscles of complicated
arrangement, and, as a rule, there must be some sort of skeleton
to support the weight of the body. The larva, if turned out in
a Gastræa condition would simply perish without a struggle<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span>
Nor is great precocity needful. The terrestrial animal is commonly
of complicated structure, active, and well furnished with
means of information. It can lay-by for its offspring, and
nourish them within its own body, or at least by food stored up
in the egg.</p>

<p>The influence of habitat upon development may be recapitulated
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marine Habitat.</span>&mdash;Eggs many. Yolk small. Segmentation
often regular. Young hatched early. Development with
metamorphosis. [The most conspicuous exceptions are Cephalopoda
and marine Vertebrata.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fluviatile Habitat.</span>&mdash;Eggs fewer. Yolk larger. Segmentation
often unequal. Young hatched later. Development
direct, or with late metamorphosis only. [The most obvious exceptions
are Frogs and Toads, which develop with metamorphosis.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terrestrial Habitat.</span>&mdash;Eggs few. Yolk large [except
where the young are supplied by maternal blood]. Segmentation
often partial. Young hatched late. Development without
metamorphosis. [An exception is found in Insects, which
usually exhibit conspicuous metamorphosis, though the yolk is
large, and the type of segmentation partial or unequal.]</p>

<p>Let us now take up the exceptions, and see whether these are
capable of satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Cephalopoda and marine Vertebrates, unlike other inhabitants
of the sea, develop without metamorphosis. But
these are large animals of relatively high intelligence, well able
to feed and protect their young until development is completely
accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span></p>

<p>2.&mdash;Frogs and Toads, unlike other fluviatile animals, develop
with metamorphosis. The last and most conspicuous change,
however, from the gill-bearing and tailed tadpole to the air-breathing
and tailless frog, hardly belongs to the ordinary
period of embryonic development. When the tadpole has four
limbs and a long tail it has already reached the point at which
the more primitive Amphibia (<i>Menopoma</i>, <i>Proteus</i>, &amp;c.) become
sexually mature. The loss of the tail, the lengthening of the
hind limbs, and the complete adaptation to pulmonary respiration,
relate to the mode of dispersal of the adult. Cut off from
early dispersal by the isolation of their breeding-places and the
difficulty of land migration, Frogs migrate from pool to pool as
full-grown animals. The eggs are thus laid in new sites, and
very small basins&mdash;ditches and pools which dry up in summer&mdash;can
be used for spawning. To this peculiar facility in finding
new spawning grounds the Anura no doubt owe their success in
life, of which the vast number of nearly-allied species furnishes
an incontrovertible proof. But the adaptation to terrestrial
locomotion necessarily comes late in life, after the normal and
primitive adult Amphibian condition has been attained. It is
by a <i>secondary adult metamorphosis</i> that the aquatic tadpole
turns into the land-traversing frog. The change is not fairly
comparable to any process of development by which other
animals gain the adult structure characteristic of their class
and order, but (in respect of the time of its occurrence)
resembles the late assumption of secondary sexual characters,
such as the antlers of the stag, or the train of the
peacock.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Lastly, we come to the exceptional case of Insects which,
unlike other terrestrial animals, develop with metamorphosis.
The Anurous Amphibia have prepared us to recognise this too
as a case of secondary adult (post-embryonic) metamorphosis.
Thysanuran or Orthopterous larvæ cannot differ very widely
from the adult form of primitive Insects. From wingless,
hexapod Insects, like Cockroach larvæ in all essentials of
external form, have been derived, on the one hand, the winged
imago, adapted in the more specialised orders to a brief pairing
season exclusively spent in migration and propagation; on the
other hand, the footless maggot or quiescent pupa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span></p>

<p>Insects, like Frogs, disperse as adults, because of the
difficulty of the medium, aerial locomotion being even more
difficult than locomotion by land, and implying the highest
muscular and respiratory efficiency. The flying state is attained
by a late metamorphosis, which has not yet become universal in
the class, while it is not found in other Tracheates at all.
<i>Peripatus</i>, Scorpions, and Myriopods become sexually mature
when they reach the stage which corresponds to the ordinary
less-modified Insect-nymph, with segmented body, walking
legs, and mouth-parts resembling those of the parent<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span></p>

<p>The Caterpillar is not, as <span class="nowrap">Harvey<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> maintained, a kind of
walking egg; it is rather the primitive adult Tracheate modified
in accordance with its own special needs. It may be sexually
immature, imperfect, destined to attain more elaborate development
in a following stage, but it nevertheless marks the stage
in which the remote Tracheate ancestor attained complete
maturity. Where it differs from the primitive form, hatched
with all the characters of the adult, the changes are adaptive
and secondary<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span></p>


<h3><i>The Genealogy of Insects.</i></h3>

<p>To construct from embryological and other data a chart of
the descent of Insects, and of the different orders within the
<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
class, is an attempt too hazardous for a student’s text-book<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span>
A review of the facts of Arthropod development led <span class="nowrap">Balfour<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span>
to conclude that the whole of the Arthropoda cannot be united
in a common phylum. The Tracheata are probably “descended
from a terrestrial Annelidan type related to <i>Peripatus</i><span class="ell">...</span>.
The Crustacea, on the other hand, are clearly descended from a
Phyllopod-like ancestor, which can be in no way related to
<i>Peripatus</i>.” The resemblances between the Arthropoda appear
therefore to be traceable to no nearer common ancestors than
some unknown Annelid, probably marine, and furnished with a
chitinous cuticle, an œsophageal nervous ring, and perhaps with
jointed appendages. Zoological convenience must give place to
the results of embryological and historical research, and we
shall probably have to reassign the classes hitherto grouped
under the easily defined sub-kingdom of Arthropoda.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock has explained, in his very interesting
treatise on the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects, the
reasons which lead him to conclude “that Insects generally
are descended from ancestors resembling the existing genus
<i>Campodea</i> [sub-order Collembola], and that these again have
arisen from others belonging to a type represented more or less
closely by the existing genus <i>Lindia</i>” [a non-ciliated Rotifer].</p>

<p>Present knowledge does not, therefore, justify a more definite
statement of the genealogy of Insects than this, that in common
with Crustacea they had Annelid ancestors, and that
<i>Lindia</i>, <i>Peripatus</i>, and <i>Campodea</i> approximately represent three
successive stages of the descent. When we reflect that Cockroaches
themselves reach back to the immeasurably distant
palæozoic epoch, we get some misty notion of the antiquity and
duration of those still remoter ages during which Tracheates,
and afterwards Insects, slowly established themselves as new
and distinct groups of animals.</p>

<p>Like all useful scavengers, the Cockroach is looked upon
nowadays as an unmitigated pest. It has, however, a certain
right to our regard, for it comes of a venerable antiquity.
Indeed, palæontologically considered, no Insect is so interesting
as the Cockroach. Of no other type of Insects can it be said
that it occurs at every horizon where Insects have been found
in any numbers; in no group whatever can the changes
<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
wrought by time be so carefully and completely studied as
here; none other has furnished more important evidence concerning
the phylogeny of Insects. Even the oldest known air-breathing
animal has been claimed (though I think erroneously)
as a Cockroach; yet, however that may be, it is certain that in
the most ancient deposits which have yielded any abundance of
Insect remains, the Coal Measures, they so far outnumber all
other types of Insects, that this period, as far as its hexapodal
fauna is concerned, may fairly be called the <i>Age of Cockroaches</i>.
And though the subsequent periods show an ever-diminishing
percentage of this family when compared with the total synchronous
Insect fauna, yet the existing species are counted by
hundreds, and the fecundity of some, attested by every housewife,
may be looked upon as a sufficient explanation of the
persistence of this antique type. The Cockroach is, therefore,
a very aristocrat among Insects.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of its past is derived almost entirely from its
wings; perhaps because these organs are the farthest removed
from the nourishing fluids of the body, which on death become
one of the agents, or at least the media, of putrefaction and
consequent obliteration. At all events, whatever the cause,
these chitinous membranes, with their network of supporting
rods, and even not infrequently with the minutest reticulation
of the membrane itself, are preserved with extraordinary fidelity,
and in such abundance that, by comparison with similar parts
in existing forms, we may reach some general conclusions
concerning the life of the past of no little interest.</p>

<p>The first thing that would strike an observer, looking at the
ancient Cockroaches, would be their <i>general</i> resemblance to the
living. Excepting for their usually larger size<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> were we to
have the oldest known Cockroaches in our kitchens to-day, the
householder would take no special note of them&mdash;unless, indeed,
the transparency of their wings (shortly to be mentioned) were
to give them a somewhat peculiar aspect. There would be the
same rounded pronotal shield, the same overlapping wings,
coursed by branching veins, the same smooth curves and oval
flattened form of the whole creature, and doubtless also the
<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
same scurrying movements. Indeed, some accurate observers&mdash;so,
I suppose, we must call them&mdash;have failed to take note of
some important and very general distinctions between the
living and the dead. Thus Gerstaecker, in a work begun
twenty years ago, and not yet finished, said, near its beginning<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span>
“Not a single species of Insect has yet been found in the Carboniferous
rocks which does not fall, on closer examination
(<i>mit voller Evidenz</i>), not only in an existing order, but even
almost completely in the same family as some living form, and
only presents striking distinctions when compared with the
species themselves.” He further specifies the Cockroaches
described from the Coal Measures, by Germar and Goldenberg,
as agreeing in every distinguishing family characteristic with
those of the present day.</p>

<p>In one sense, indeed, this is true. We separate the living
Cockroaches from other kinds of Orthoptera as a “family”
group, and “Cockroaches” have existed since the Coal
Measures at least; yet the structure of every one of the older
types is really so peculiar that none of them can be brought
within the limits of the family as it now exists. We recognise
ours, indeed, as the direct descendants of the ancient forms, but
so changed in structure as to form a distinct group. A parallel
case is found in the Walking-sticks, and is even more obvious.
The recent researches of M. Charles Brongniart have brought
to view a whole series of forms in Carboniferous times, which
are manifestly the progenitors of living Walking-sticks, with
their remarkably long and slender stick-like body, attenuated
legs, and peculiar appendages at the tip of the abdomen. Existing
forms are either wingless or else have opaque elytron-like
front wings, and very ample, gauzy, fan-like hind wings; while
the Carboniferous species are furnished with four membranous
wings, almost precisely alike, and so utterly different from those
of existing types that, before the discovery of the bodies, these
wings were universally classed as the wings of Neuropterous
Insects (sensu Linneano). Thus Gerstaecker, in the very place
already quoted, says of these same wings, known under the
generic name <i>Dictyoneura</i>, that they show at least a very close
relationship to the <i>Ephemeridæ</i> of to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span></p>

<p>One principal difference here alluded to&mdash;the exact resemblance,
except in minor details, of the front and hind wings,
and, as consequent therewith, <i>equal diaphaneity in both</i>&mdash;is found
indeed in all palæozoic insects, with exceedingly few exceptions<span class="nowrap">;<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span>
it is one of their most characteristic and pervading peculiarities.
It marks one phase of the movement in all life from homogeneity
to heterogeneity&mdash;from the uniform to the diverse. In
the Cockroaches of to-day a few are found in which the tegmina
are nearly as diaphanous as the hind wings; but in the great
mass the texture of the tegmina, as in Orthoptera generally
(excepting most Gryllides), is decidedly coriaceous; and in
some, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Phoraspis</i>, the veins are nearly obliterated in the
thickness and opacity of the membrane, so as to resemble many
Coleopterous elytra.</p>

<p>Three principal differences have been noticed between the
ancient and modern forms of Cockroaches. Doubtless others
could be found were we able to compare the structure of all
parts of the body; and perhaps future research and more happy
discovery may yet bring them to light; at present, however,
we are compelled to restrict our comparisons to the wings
alone.</p>

<p>First, we have to remark the similarity of the front and hind
wings in the ancient types: a similarity which extends to their
general form (the extended anal area of the hind wings in
modern types being as yet only slightly differentiated); their
nearly equal size (a corollary, to a certain extent, of the last);
the general course of their neuration (true, in a limited sense
only, of modern types); and the complete transparency of the
front as well as of the hind wing.</p>

<p>Second, the same number of principal veins is developed in
the front and hind wings of ancient Cockroaches; while in the
front wings of modern types two or more of the veins are
blended, so as to reduce the number of the principal stems
below the normal, the hind wing at the same time retaining its
original simplicity. These principal veins are six, counting the
marginal vein, which here merely thickens the anterior border,
as one; to use the terminology of Heer, and starting from the
anterior margin, they are the <i>marginal</i>, <i>mediastinal</i>, <i>scapular</i>,<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
<i>externomedian</i>, <i>internomedian</i>, and <i>anal</i>. The general disposition
of these veins is as follows:&mdash;The mediastinal and scapular veins,
with their branches, which are superior (<i>i.e.</i>, part from the main
vein on the upper or anterior side), terminate upon the anterior
margin. The internomedian and anal take the opposite course,
and their branches are inferior, or, at least, directed toward the
inner margin; while the externomedian, interposed between
these two sets, terminates at the tip of the wing, and branches
indifferently on either side.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/i_p209.jpg" width="220" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 119.&mdash;Schematic view of Wing of Palæo­zoic Cock­roach, show­ing the
veins and areas.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now these veins are all present in both front and hind wings
of palæozoic Cockroaches, and also in the hind wings of existing
species; but in the front wings or tegmina of the latter the
number is never complete, the externomedian vein being always
amalgamated either with the scapular, or with the internomedian,
and the mediastinal frequently blended with the
scapular vein.</p>

<p>The hind wings are thus shown to be conservative elements
of structure, since they have preserved from the highest
antiquity both their transparency and their normal number of<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
veins. They have retained the use to which they were first put,
and the changes that have come about, such as the wider expansion
of the anal area, have been in fuller development of the
same purpose; while the front wings, in virtue of their position
in repose, have become more and more protectors of the hind
wings, and have gradually lost, in part, if not entirely, their
original use. The hind wings of existing Insects, thus protected,
have given less play to selective action, and have become
to some degree interpreters for us of the more complicated
structure, the more modernised anatomy, the more varied
organisation of the front wing.</p>

<p>A third distinction between palæozoic and modern Cockroaches
is found in the veinlets of the anal area. These, unlike the
branches of the other veins, do not part from the main anal
vein at various points along its course, but form a series of
semi-independent veinlets, and in palæozoic Cockroaches take
the same general course as the main anal vein, or “anal
furrow” (the curved, deeply sunken vein that marks off the
anal area from the rest of the front wing, both in ancient and
modern Cockroaches), and terminate at sub-equidistant intervals
upon the inner margin; while in modern Cockroaches these
veins either run sub-parallel to the inner margin and terminate
on the descending portion of the anal furrow, or they form a
fusiform bundle and terminate in proximity to one another and
to the tip of the anal furrow.</p>

<p>These differences, which were mentioned by Germar and
Goldenberg, and their universality pointed out in my memoir
on Palæozoic Cockroaches<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> seem to warrant our separating the
older forms from the modern as a family group, under the name
of <i>Palæoblattariæ</i>; this family has been thus <span class="nowrap">characterised:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Fore wings diaphanous, generally reticulated, and nearly
symmetrical on either side of a median line. Externomedian
vein completely developed, forking in the outer half of the
wing, its branches generally occupying the apical margin;
internomedian area broad at base (beyond the anal area),
rapidly tapering apically, and filled with oblique mostly parallel
veins, having nearly the same direction as the anal veinlets,
which, like them, strike the inner margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p>About eighty palæozoic species have been published up to the
present time, and have been grouped in two sub-families and
thirteen genera. Besides these, Brongniart has not yet given
any hint of how many have been found at Commentry, a
French locality which may be expected to increase the number
largely, and about twenty undescribed species are known to me
from the American Carboniferous rocks.</p>

<p>The two tribes or sub-families differ in the structure of the
mediastinal vein; in one type (<i>Blattinariæ</i>) the branches part
from the main stem as in the other veins, at varying distances
along its course (see the figure of <i>Etoblattina</i>); in the other
(<i>Mylacridæ</i>) they spread like unequal rays of a fan from the
very base of the wing (see the figure of <i>Mylacris</i>). What is<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
curious is that the latter type has been found only in the New
World, while the former is common to Europe and America.
The latter appears to be the more archaic type, since it is
probable that the primeval Insect wing was broad at the base,
as is the general rule in palæozoic wings, and had the veins
somewhat symmetrically disposed on either side of a middle
line; in this case the mediastinal and anal areas would be
somewhat similar and more or less triangular in form, and the
space they occupied would be most readily filled by radiating
veins; such a condition of things, which we find in the
<i>Mylacridæ</i>, would naturally precede one in which the mediastinal
vein, to strengthen the part of the wing most liable to strain,
should, as in the <i>Blattinariæ</i>, follow the basal curve of the
costal margin, and throw its branches off at intervals toward
the border, much after the fashion of the mediastinal vein.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<a id="Fig_121"></a><img src="images/i_p212.jpg" width="210" height="292" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 121.&mdash;<i>Mylacris an­thra­co­phil­um</i> Scudd. ×&nbsp;2. Car­bon­if­erous, Illinois.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This view of the relative antiquity of the two tribes of
<i>Palæoblattariæ</i> is supported by the fact that while in both of
them the internomedian branches show a tendency to repeat
the general course of the anal nervules, as in the corresponding
veins of the costal region, this tendency is lost in modern types;
and among those ancient <i>Blattinariæ</i>, which are esteemed
highest in the series, there is a marked tendency toward a loss<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
of this repetition of the style of branching of the mediastinal
and anal offshoots by the scapular and internomedian respectively.</p>

<p>A certain amount of geological evidence may also be claimed
in support of this view. A survey of the species of the two
groups found up to the present time in America, published and
unpublished, shows that all the <i>Mylacridæ</i> are found below the
Upper Carboniferous, while more than half the <i>Blattinariæ</i> are
found in or above it. This results largely from a recent and
as yet unpublished discovery of <i>Blattinariæ</i> in the Upper Coal
Measures of Ohio and West Virginia, which in their general
features are much nearer than previously discovered American
Cockroaches to the European <i>Blattinariæ</i>, the latter of which
come generally from Upper Carboniferous beds. The <i>Mylacridæ</i>
have therefore been found in America in strata generally
regarded as older than those which in Europe have yielded
Cockroaches, and this gives a sufficient explanation why no
<i>Mylacridæ</i> have yet been found in the Old World. In America
one is mostly dealing with absolutely older forms, and they
naturally give that continent a more old-fashioned look, when
we regard the Carboniferous fauna as a whole. As already
stated, a wing from the French Silurian (<i>Palæoblattina Douvillei</i>
Brongn.) has been claimed as a Cockroach, but without good
reason, and to see a real old Cockroach one must look to
America.</p>

<p>Up to this point we have contrasted the palæozoic Cockroaches
with the existing forms only, and finding such important distinctions
between them, we naturally turn with some curiosity
to the intermediate mesozoic and tertiary formations.</p>

<p>Now, not only are the mesozoic species as numerous (actually,
but not relatively) as the palæozoic, but a recent discovery of a
Triassic fauna of considerable extent, in the elevated parks of
Colorado, presents us with a series of intermediate forms
between those peculiar to the Coal Measures and those characteristic
of the later mesozoic rocks. Excluding, however, for a
moment this Triassic fauna, we may say of the later mesozoic
species that they are <i>Neoblattariæ</i>, not <i>Palæoblattariæ</i>, though
they still show some lingering characteristics of their ancestry.
Thus the front wings are in general of a less dense texture than<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
in modern times, but without the perfect diaphaneity of the
palæozoic species; in some the anal veins fall in true palæoblattarian
fashion on the inner margin, while in others which
cannot be dissociated generically from them, the anal veins are
disposed as in modern types. But in all there is a loss of one
of the principal veins, or rather an amalgamation of two or
more&mdash;a characteristic of more fundamental character. As a
general rule, moreover, to which we shall again advert, the
mass of the species are of small size, in very striking contrast
to the older types.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
<a id="Fig_122"></a><img src="images/i_p214.jpg" width="160" height="235" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 122.&mdash;<i>Neorthro­blat­tina Lakesii</i> Scudd. ×&nbsp;5. Trias, Colorado.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To return now to the Triassic deposits of Colorado, we recognize
here an assemblage of forms of a strictly intermediate
character. Here are <i>Palæoblattariæ</i> and <i>Neoblattariæ</i>, side by
side. The larger proportion are <i>Palæoblattariæ</i>, but all of them
are specifically, and most of them generically, distinct from
palæozoic species, and all rank high among <i>Blattinariæ</i>; still
further, the species are all of moderate size, their general
average being but little above that of mesozoic Cockroaches,
and only a little more than half that of palæozoic types. The
<i>Neoblattariæ</i> of this Triassic deposit are still smaller, being
actually smaller than the average mesozoic Cockroach, and one
or two of them, of the genus <i>Neorthroblattina</i> (see figure of
<i>N. Lakesii</i>), have marked affinity to one of the genera of
Palæoblattariæ (<i>Poroblattina</i>) peculiar to the same beds, differing
mainly in the union or separation of the mediastinal
and scapular veins; while others, as <i>Scutinoblattina</i>, have a<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
<i>Phoraspis</i>-like aspect and density of membrane. This novel
assemblage of species bridges over the distinctions between the
<i>Palæoblattariæ</i> and <i>Neoblattariæ</i>. We find, first, forms in which
the front wings are diaphanous, with distinct mediastinal and
scapular veins, and the anal veinlets run to the border of the
wing (<i>Spiloblattina</i>, <i>Poroblattina</i>); next, those having a little
opacity of the front wings, with blended mediastinal and
scapular, and the anal veins as before (some species of <i>Neorthroblattina</i>);
then those with still greater opacity, with the same
structural features (other species of <i>Neorthroblattina</i>); next,
those having a coriaceous or leathery structure, blended
mediastinal and scapular, and anal veins falling on the inner
margin (some species of <i>Scutinoblattina</i>); and, finally, similarly
thickened wings with blended mediastinal and scapular, and
anal veins impinging on the anal furrow (other species of
<i>Scutinoblattina</i>).</p>

<p>It is not alone, however, by the union of the mediastinal and
scapular stems that the reduction of the veins in the wings of
later Cockroaches has come about; for in many mesozoic types
the externomedian vein is blended with one of its neighbours,
while in others not only are the mediastinal and scapular
united, but at the same time the externomedian and internomedian.</p>

<p>As regards the other structural distinction between the
<i>Palæoblattariæ and Neoblattariæ</i>&mdash;the course of the anal
nervules&mdash;there is much diversity, and very imperfect knowledge,
since this very portion of the wing is not infrequently
lost, a fracture most readily occurring at the anal furrow. In
most of the mesozoic genera, the anal nervules, as far as known,
strike the margin; but the larger portion of these show a decided
tendency to trend toward the tip of the anal furrow, as in many
modern forms. This feature can hardly be considered as firmly
established in mesozoic times, and the same genus, as <i>Scutinoblattina</i>,
may contain species which differ in this respect.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<a id="Fig_123"></a><img src="images/i_p216.jpg" width="150" height="236" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 123.&mdash;<i>Meso­blat­tina Brodiei</i> Scudd. ×&nbsp;4. Pur­becks, England.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A further peculiarity of mesozoic Cockroaches, already
alluded to, is their generally small size. The average length of
the front wing of palæozoic Cockroaches has been estimated to
be 26&nbsp;mm., that of the Triassic <i>Palæoblattariæ</i> is about 16&nbsp;mm.,
while that of the mesozoic <i>Neoblattariæ</i> is 12·5&nbsp;mm. One<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
exception to this small size must be noted in the species from
the Jura of Solenhofen, all of which were large and some
gigantic, one wing reaching the length of 60&nbsp;mm., or about the
size of our largest tropical <i>Blaberæ</i>. If we omit these exceptional
forms, the average length of the wing of the mesozoic
Cockroach would be scarcely more than 11&nbsp;mm. Now an
average of the 243 species of which the measurements are
given in Brunner’s Système des Blattaires (1865), gives the
length of the front wing of living Cockroaches as a little over
18&nbsp;mm.; so that the mesozoic Cockroaches were as a rule considerably
smaller, the palæozoic Cockroaches much larger, than
the living.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 124.&mdash;<i>Blat­tid­ium Simy­rus</i> Westw. ×&nbsp;3. Lower Pur­becks, England.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nearly eighty species of mesozoic <i>Neoblattariæ</i> are known,
and they are divided into thirteen genera<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> one of which,
<i>Mesoblattina</i> (see figure of <i>M. Brodiei</i>), contains upwards of
twenty species, mainly from the Lias and Oolites of England.
The Upper Oolite has proved the most prolific, considerably
more than half the species having been found in the English
Purbecks, while nearly a fourth occur in the Lias of England,
Switzerland, and Germany. Many of the English species have
been figured in Brodie’s Fossil Insects of the Secondary Rocks
of England, in Westwood’s paper on Fossil Insects in the
tenth volume of the Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society, and in the memoir alluded to above. No species has
yet been found in rocks of different geological horizons, and the<span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
genera of the Trias are peculiar to it. So, too, are some of the
genera of the Oolite, but all of the Liassic genera occur also in
the Oolite.</p>

<p>Among these mesozoic Cockroaches are some of very peculiar
aspect; one, <i>Blattidium</i> (see figure of <i>B. Simyrus</i>), found only
in the lower Purbecks, has ribbon-shaped wings with parallel
sides, longitudinal neuration, and anal nervures with a course
at right angles to their usual direction; another, <i>Pterinoblattina</i>
(see figure of <i>P. intermixta</i>), geologically widespread, is very
broad, more or less triangular, and has an exceedingly fine and
delicate neuration, so arranged as to resemble the barbs of a
feather.</p>

<p>A comparison of the neuration of the tegmina of mesozoic
and recent Cockroaches, to determine as far as possible the
immediate relations of the former to existing types, gives
as yet little satisfaction. The prolific genera, <i>Mesoblattina</i> and
<i>Rithma</i>, may be said to bear considerable resemblance to the
<i>Phyllodromidæ</i>, and the peculiar neuration of <i>Elisama</i> is in part
repeated in the <i>Panchloridæ</i>, as well as in some <i>Phyllodromidæ</i><span class="pagenum" title="218"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span>
and <i>Epilampridæ</i>. <i>Scutinoblattina</i> also reminds one in certain
features of some <i>Epilampridæ</i>, like <i>Phoraspis</i>. The other
genera appear to have no special relations to any existing
type. As a whole, it would appear as if the <i>Blattariæ spinosæ</i>
approached closer to the mesozoic forms than do the <i>Blattariæ
muticæ</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>As to the tertiary Cockroaches we know very little, exceedingly
few having been preserved, even in amber&mdash;that
wonderful treasury of fossil Insects. Here first we come
across apterous forms, <i>Polyzosteria</i> having been recognised
in Prussian amber<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> together with winged species, which
seem to be <i>Phyllodromidæ</i>; these are the only <i>Blattariæ spinosæ</i>
known from the Tertiaries. Of the other group, we have
<i>Zetobora</i>, one of the <i>Panchloridæ</i>, and <i>Paralatindia</i>, one of the
<i>Corydidæ</i>, from American rocks, and <i>Heterogamia</i> and <i>Homœogamia</i>,
one from Parschlug in Steiermark, the other from
Florissant in Colorado, belonging to the sub-family <i>Heterogamidæ</i>.
Others are mentioned, generally under the wide generic
term <i>Blatta</i>, from Oeningen, Eisleben, Rott, and even from
Spitzbergen and Greenland; but little more than their names
are known to us. <i>Paralatindia</i>, from the Green River beds of
Wyoming, U.S., is the only tertiary Cockroach yet referred
to an extinct genus; but close attention has not yet been paid
even to the few tertiary Cockroaches which we know. There
is no reason to suppose that they will be found to differ more
from the existing types than is generally the case with other<span class="pagenum" title="219"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
Insects. The more we learn of cænozoic Insects, the more truly
do we find that the early Tertiary period was in truth the dawn
of the present, the distinction between the faunas of these
remotely separated times (though not to be compared in
character) being scarcely greater than is found to-day between
the Insects of the temperate and torrid zones.</p>

<p>We began this review with the statement that no Insect was
so important palæontologically as the Cockroach. This would
more clearly appear had we space to pass in review the geological
history of all the Insect tribes; for then it could be shown
that it was only in the passage from palæozoic to mesozoic times
that the great ordinal groups of Insects were differentiated, and
that the Triassic period therefore becomes the expectant ground
of the student of fossil Insects. Up to the present time we do
not know half a dozen Insects besides Cockroaches from these
rocks. Yet, notwithstanding this advantage on the part of the
Cockroaches, how meagre is the history, how striking the
“imperfection of the geological record” concerning them, the
following tabulation of the fossil species by their genera will show.</p>

<p>It here appears that there are about 80 species known
from the palæozoic rocks, two or three more than that from the
mesozoic, and only nine from the cænozoic! When we call to
mind that half the palæozoic Insects were Cockroaches, and that
seven or eight hundred species exist to-day, what shall we say
of the paltry <span class="nowrap">dozen<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> from the rich tertiaries? Shall we claim
that these figures represent their true numerical proportion to
their numbers in the more distant past? Then, indeed, must
the palæozoic period have been the Age of Cockroaches; for all
research into the past shows that a type once losing ground
continues to lose it, and does not again regain its strength.
The Cockroaches of to-day are no longer, as once, a dominant
group; they are but a fragment of the world’s Insect-hosts;
yet even now the species are numbered by hundreds. If this
be a waning type, what must its numbers have been in the far-off
time, when the warm moisture which they still love was the
prevailing climatic feature of the world; and how few of that
vast horde have been preserved to us! The housekeeper will
thank God and take courage.</p>

<p class="tac">SENSE OF SMELL IN INSECTS.</p>

<p>Since the printing of the sheets which describe the organs of
special sense, we have become acquainted with two experimental
researches of recent date, instituted for the purpose of determining
whether other organs, besides the antennæ, may be specially concerned
with the perception of odours by Insects.</p>

<p>Prof. Graber (Biol. Centralblatt, Bd. V., 1885) has described
extensive and elaborate experiments upon various Insects, tending
to the conclusion that the palps and the cerci may be sensitive to
odours, and that in special cases the palps may be even more
sensitive in this respect than the antennæ. Cockroaches, decapitated,
but kept alive for some days, were found to perceive odours
by means of their cerci. His general conclusion is that Insects
have no special sense of smell, but that various parts of the surface
of the body are furnished with nerve-endings capable of perceiving
strong odours. Prof. Graber’s results are known to us only through
the abstract given by Prof. Plateau in the paper next to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>Prof. Plateau (Compt. rend. de la Soc. Entom. de Belgique, 1886)
relates experiments upon the powers of scent resident in different
organs of the Cockroach. Two Cockroaches had their palps (maxillary
and labial) removed; two others had the antennæ removed.
An evaporating dish, 8 inches in diameter, was then partly filled with<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
fine sand. In the centre of the dish was set a circular box of card,
without bottom, 2 inches in diameter, and <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">4</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">5</span></span></span> inches high. In this box
bread moistened with beer, a bait very attractive to Cockroaches,
was placed, and renewed daily. The four Cockroaches were allowed
to run about in the dish outside the box, and to feed upon the
bread at pleasure by climbing over the enclosure. Observations
were made late at night for a month, when it was found that,
except on the first night, when the Insects ran all over the dish,
none of the Cockroaches without antennæ made their way to the
food; while twenty-three times one of the Cockroaches without palps,
but with antennæ intact, was found to be feeding; in one instance,
both were so found.</p>

<p>Plateau observes that a special sense of smell can only be claimed
for organs which are able to detect faint and distant odours, and
that experiments made with powerful odours close to the body of
the Insect may lead to fallacious results. The perception of faint
odours cannot be effected by the palps or cerci of the Cockroach,
but only by the antennæ.</p>

For example, the Russians often call it <i>Proussaki</i>, the Prussian Cockroach, and
believe that their troops brought it home with them after the Seven Years’ War.
The native Russian name is <i>Tarakan</i>. In Finland and Sweden the same species is
called <i>Torraka</i>, which appears to be a corruption of the Russian word, and confirms
the account of Linnæus quoted above.

<i>B. germanica</i> is found in the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is

The use of the term <i>pupa</i> to denote the last stage before the complete assumption
of wings in the Cockroach, is liable to mislead. There is no resting-stage at all;
wings are developed gradually, and are nearly as conspicuous in the last larval state
as in the so-called pupa. There seems no reason for speaking of pupæ in this case.

Professor J. Wood-Mason points out that in <i>Machilis</i> (one of the Thysanura) the
mandible shows signs of segmentation, while the apical portion is deeply divided into
an inner and an outer half. Ripe embryos of <i>Panesthia (Blatta) javanica</i> are said to
exhibit folds which indicate the consolidation of the mandible out of separate joints,
while the cutting and crushing portions of the edge are divided by a “sutural mark,”
which may correspond to the line of junction of the divisions of a biramous appendage

Charles Brongniart has lately described a fossil Insect from the Coal Measures of
Commentry, which he names <i>Corydaloides Scudderi</i>, and refers to the Pseudo-Neuroptera.
In this Insect every ring of the abdomen carries laminæ, upon which
the ramified tracheæ can still be made out by the naked eye. Stigmata co-existed
with these tracheal gills. (Bull. Soc. Sci. Nat. de Rouen, 1885.)
</p>

<p>
Some Crustacea are furnished with respiratory leaflets, curiously like those of
Tracheates, with which, however, they have no genetic connection. In Isopod
Crustacea the exopodites of the anterior abdominal segments often form opercula,
which protect the succeeding limbs. In the terrestrial Isopods, <i>Porcellio</i> and
<i>Armadillo</i>, these opercula contain ramified air-tubes, which open externally, and
much resemble tracheæ. The anterior abdominal appendages of <i>Tylus</i> are provided
with air-chambers, each lodging brush-like bundles of air-tubes, which open to the
outer air. Lamellæ, projecting inwards from the sides of the abdominal segments,
incompletely cover in the hinder part of the ventral surface of the abdomen, and
protect the modified appendages. (Milne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crustacés, Vol.&nbsp;III.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">80</a>
Gerstaecker has found in the two first abdominal segments of <i>Corydia carunculigera</i>
(<i>Blattariæ</i>) pleural appendages, which are hollow and capable of protrusion.
They have no relation to the stigmata, which are present in the same segments, and
their function is quite unknown. See Arch. f. Naturg., 1861, p.&nbsp;107.</p></div>

Jointed cerci are commonly found in Orthoptera (including Pseudo-Neuroptera);
in the Earwig they become modified and form the forceps. The “caudal filaments”
of <i>Apus</i> are curiously like cerci.
</p>

<p>
The cerci are concealed in the American <i>Cryptocercus</i>, Scudd. (Fam. <i>Panesthidæ</i>).</p></div>

From more recent observations it is probable that abdominal appendages are

Hymenoptera. The subject is rapidly advancing, and more will be known very
shortly.</p></div>

The exceptions relate chiefly to the alary muscles of the pericardial septum.
Lowne (Blow-fly, p.&nbsp;5, and pl.&nbsp;v.) states that some of the thoracic muscles of that
Insect are not striated.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">86</a>
For example, Prof. Huxley, in his Anatomy of Invertebrated Animals (p.&nbsp;254),
says that “as the hard skeleton [of Arthropods] is hollow, and the muscles are
inside it, it follows that the body, or a limb, is bent towards that side of its axis,
which is opposite to that on which a contracting muscle is situated.” The flexor
muscles of the tail of the Crayfish, which, according to the above rule, should be
extensors, the muscles of the mandibles of an Insect, and the flexors and extensors
of Crustacean pincers are among the many conspicuous exceptions to this rule.</p></div>

This change in the relation of weight to strength, according to the size of the
structure, has long been familiar to engineers. (See, for example, “Comparisons of
Similar Structures as to Elasticity, Strength, and Stability,” by Prof. James
Thomson, Trans. Inst. Engineers, &amp;c., Scotland, 1876.) The application to animal
structures has been made by Herbert Spencer (Principles of Biology, Pt. II., ch. i.).
The principle can be readily explained by models. Place a cubical block upon a
square column. Double all the dimensions in a second model, which may be done
by fitting together eight cubes like the first, and four columns, also the same as before
except in length. Each column, though no stronger than before, has now to bear
twice the weight.</p></div>

The contents of the Malpighian tubules may be examined by crushing the part
in a drop of dilute acetic acid, or in dilute sulphuric acid (10 per cent.). In the first
case a cover-slip is placed on the fluid, and the crystals, which consist of oblique
rhombohedrons, or derived forms, are usually at once apparent. If sulphuric acid
is used, the fluid must be allowed to evaporate. In this case they are much more
elongated, and usually clustered. The murexide reaction does not give satisfactory
indications with the tubules of the Cockroach.</p></div>

Insects, describes the inlets (<i>e. g.</i>, in <i>Dytiscus</i>) as situated, not at the hinder end, but
in the middle of each segment. We have not been able to discover such an arrangement
in the heart of the Cockroach.</p></div>

The oldest Tracheate actually known to bear spiracles is the Silurian Scorpion
of Gothland and Scotland (Scudder, in Zittel’s Palæontologie, p.&nbsp;738). We need
not say that this is very far removed from the primitive Tracheate which morphological
theory requires. The existing <i>Peripatus</i> makes a nearer approach to the
ideal ancestor of all Tracheates, if we suppose that all Tracheates had a common
ancestor of any kind, which is not as yet beyond doubt.</p></div>

Investigators are not yet agreed as to the minute structure of the tracheal
thread. Chun (Abh. d. Senkenberg. Naturf. Gesells., Bd. X., 1876) considers it an
independent chitinous formation, not a mere thickening of the intima. He describes
the thread as solid. The intima itself is, he believes, divisible in the larger tubes
into an inner and an outer layer, into both of which the thread is sunk. Macloskie
(Amer. Nat., June, 1884) describes the spiral as a fine tubule, opening by a fissure
along its length. He regards it as a hollow crenulation of the intima, and continuous
therewith. Packard (Amer. Nat. Mag., May, 1886) endeavours to show that
the thread is not spiral, but consists of parallel thickenings of the intima. He is
unable to find proof of the tubular structure, or of the external fissure. We
have specially examined the trachea of the Cockroach, and find that the thread can
readily be unwound for several turns. It is truly spiral.</p></div>

The crystals have been supposed to consist of oxalate of lime (Duchamp, Rev.
des sci. nat. Montpellier, Tom. VIII.). Hallez observes that they are prismatic, with
rhombic base, the angles truncated. They are insoluble in water and weak nitric
acid, but dissolve rapidly in strong sulphuric acid without liberation of gas, and still
more rapidly in caustic potash. (Compt. Rend., Aug., 1885.)</p></div>

It is usually stated that the spermatheca of the Cockroach opens into the
uterus, as it does in most other Insects, but this is not true. Locusts and Grasshoppers
have the outlet of the spermatheca placed as in the Cockroach; in other
European Orthoptera, it lies upon the dorsal wall of the uterus. (Berlese, loc. cit.,
p. 273.)</p></div>

It is a striking proof of the sagacity of Malpighi, that he should have observed
in the Silkworm the spermatophore of the male (“in spiram circumvolutum persimile
semen”) and the spermatheca of the female. His reasoning as to the
function of the spermatheca wanted nothing but microscopic evidence of the actual
transference of spermatozoa to establish it in all points. Audouin and Siebold
supplied what was wanting nearly two centuries later, but they mistook the spirally
wound spermatophore for a broken-off penis, and Stein (Weibl. Geschlechtsorgane
der Käfer, p.&nbsp;85) first arrived at the complete proof of Malpighi’s explanation.</p></div>

The descriptions and figures of the reproductive appendages of female Orthoptera
by Lacaze-Duthiers (Ann. Sci. Nat., 1852) are so often consulted, that it may
be useful to explain how we understand and name the same parts. In pl.&nbsp;xi., fig.&nbsp;2,
8′ and 9′ are the 8th and 9th terga; the anterior gonapophyses are seen to be
attached to them below; <i>a</i> (figs. 2 and 4) is the base of the same appendage, but the
twisted ends are incorrect; the 8th sternum is seen at the back (figs. 2 and 4);

The spermatocysts are peculiar to Insects and Amphibia. They arise by
division of the spermatospores, or modified epithelial cells, and form hollow cysts,
within which sperm cells (or spermatoblasts) are developed by further division.
The sperm cells are usually placed radiately around the wall of the spermatocyst.
They escape by dehiscence, and are transformed into spermatozoa.</p></div>

In <i>Gryllotalpa</i> (Dohrn), as in Spiders, some Myriopods and <i>Peripatus</i> (Moseley,
Phil. Trans., 1874), each stigma, with its branches, constitutes throughout life a
separate system. The salivary glands arise in the same way, not, like the salivary
glands of Vertebrates, as extensions of the alimentary canal, but as independent
pits opening behind the mouth. Both the tracheal and the salivary passages are
believed to be special modifications of cutaneous glands (Moseley).</p></div>

It may be useful to point out the following examples of parental care among
animals in which, as a rule, the eggs are left to take care of themselves. It will be
found that in general this instinct is associated with high zoological rank (best
exemplified by Mammals and Birds), land or freshwater habitat, reduced number of
eggs, and direct development.
</p>

<div class="blockquot fs100">

<p><span class="smcap">Amphibia.</span>&mdash;The eggs are sometimes hatched by the male (<i>Alytes obstetricans</i>,
<i>Rhinoderma Darwinii</i>), or placed by the male in pouches on the back of the
female (<i>Pipa dorsigera</i>, <i>Notodelphis ovifera</i>, <i>Nototrema marsupiatum</i>), or
carried during hatching by the female (<i>Polypedates reticulatus</i>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Fishes.</span>&mdash;The Stickleback and others build nests. Of eleven genera of nest-building
Fishes, eight are freshwater. The number of eggs is unusually small.
Many Siluroids have the eggs hatched in the mouth of the males, a few under
the belly of the female. The species are both marine and freshwater, the eggs
few and large. Lophobranchiate fishes usually have the eggs hatched by the male.
They are marine; the eggs few and large. Many sharks hatch their eggs, which
are very few, within the body. <i>Mustelus lævis</i> has a placenta formed out of the
yolk-sac.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Insects.</span>&mdash;De Geer has described the incubation of the Earwig, and the care of
the brood by the female. The cases of the social Hymenoptera, &amp;c., are
universally known.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Spiders.</span>&mdash;The care of the female spider for her eggs is well known.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Crustaceans.</span>&mdash;The Crayfish hatches and subsequently protects her young. <i>Mysis</i>,
<i>Diastylis</i> (<i>Cuma</i>), and some Isopods hatch their eggs. <i>Gammarus locusta</i> is
followed about by her brood, which shelter beneath her when alarmed. <i>Podocerus
capillatus</i> builds a nest among corallines. Several of the <i>Caprellidæ</i> hatch or
otherwise protect their young. All these, except the Crayfish, are marine; the
eggs commonly fewer than usual.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Echinoderms.</span>&mdash;Many cases of “marsupial development” have been recorded
in the species of the Southern seas. Here development, contrary to the rule in
Echinodermata, is direct.</p></div></div>

The minute and early larvæ of <i>Tœnia</i> and <i>Distomum</i> may appear to contradict

many Infusoria.</p></div>

“Alia vero semen adhuc imperfectum et immaturatum recludunt, incrementum

ranæ, item mollia, crustata, testacea, et cochleæ: quorum ova primum exposita sunt,
veluti origines duntaxat, inceptiones et vitelli; qui postea albumina sibi ipsis circum

in perfectum semen atque ovum evadunt. Talia sunt insectorum semina (vermes ab

it to the histolysis and regeneration of the tissues in Diptera. But these remarkable
changes are surely secondary, adaptive, and peculiar, like the footless maggot
itself, whose conversion into a swift-flying imago renders necessary so complete a
reconstruction.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
